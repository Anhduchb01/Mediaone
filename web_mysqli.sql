All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <p><span>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writ­ing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth- shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. <br><br> Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">noticeable</span><span>—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.<br><br> Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little dif­ference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. <br><br> This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a million­aire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. <br> Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. <br><br> But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little ex­cuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumu­lation of many missteps—1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. <br><br> The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magni­fied across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.<br><br> Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the differ­ence between who you are and who you could be. Success is the prod­uct of daily habits—not once‑in‑a‑lifetime transformations. <br><br> That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your cur­rent trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re mov­ing slower than you’d like. <br><br> Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. <br><br> If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny bat­tles like these are the ones that will define your future self. <br><br> Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. <br><br> Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.<br><br></span></p>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	11.98,	27,	0,	'Avery; Illustrated edition (October 16, 2018)',	'English',	'320 pages',	'1.18 pounds',	'6.29 x 1.04 x 9.4 inches',	'080ac688498d84caf266c0f2e583ffdc8cbec702.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

He knew the rough outlines of the story he wanted to tell. The film would open with Riley, uprooted from her Minnesota hometown and plunked down in a new house and school in San Francisco, while also caught in the emotional storm of incoming adolescence.<br><br>So far, so good. But Docter faced a creative puzzle. He wanted to depict Riley’s feelings as lovable animated characters running a control center in her brain, shaping her memories and daily life. But which feelings? Psychologists told him that we have up to twenty-seven different emotions. But you can’t tell a good story about so many different characters. Docter needed to narrow it down, and to pick one emotion as the main protagonist.<br><br>He considered a few different emotions for the starring role, then decided to place Fear at the center of the movie, alongside Joy; partly, he says, because Fear is funny. He considered Sadness, but this seemed unappealing. Docter had grown up in Minnesota, where, he told me, the sanguine norms were clear: “The idea that you’d cry in front of people was very uncool.”<br><br>But three years into the development of the film—with the dialogue already done, the movie partially animated, the gags with Fear already in place, some of them “quite inspired”—he realized that something was wrong. Docter was scheduled to screen the film-in-progress for Pixar’s executive team. And he was sure it was a failure. The third act didn’t work. According to the film’s narrative arc, Joy should have learned a great lesson. But Fear had nothing to teach her.<br><br>At that point in his career, Docter had enjoyed two mega-successes—Up and Monsters, Inc. But he started to feel sure that these hits were flukes.<br><br>“I don’t know what I’m doing,” he thought. “I should just quit.”<br><br>His mind spun into dark daydreams of a post-Pixar future in which he’d lost not only his job but also his career. He went into preemptive mourning. The thought of living outside his treasured community of creatives and business mavericks made him feel he was drowning—in Sadness. And the more despondent he grew, the more he realized how much he loved his colleagues.<br><br>Which led to his epiphany: The real reason for his emotions—for all our emotions—is to connect us. And Sadness, of all the emotions, was the ultimate bonding agent.<br><br>“I suddenly had an idea that we needed to get Fear out of there,” he recalls now, “and Sadness connected with Joy.” The only problem was, he had to convince John Lasseter, who ran Pixar at the time, to place Sadness at the heart of the movie. And he was worried that this would be a tough sell.<br><br>Docter tells me this story as we sit in the airy, light-filled atrium designed by Steve Jobs for Pixar’s Emeryville, California, campus. We’re surrounded by larger-than-life sculptures of Pixar characters—the Parr family from The Incredibles, Buzz from Toy Story, all of them striking poses by sky-high glass windows. Docter enjoys cult status at Pixar. Earlier that day, I’d led an executive session on harnessing the talents of introverted filmmakers, and a few minutes into the proceedings, Docter had bounded into the conference room, instantly lighting up the room with his warmth.<br><br>Docter resembles an animated character himself, drawn mainly of rectangles. He has a gangly six-foot-four frame and a long face, half of which is forehead. Even his teeth are long and rectangular, the beanpoles of the dental world. But his most salient feature is the animation of his facial expressions. His smiles and grimaces convey a bright, winsome sensitivity. When he was a kid, his family moved to Copenhagen so his father could research a Ph.D. on Danish choral music. Docter didn’t speak the language and had no idea what the other kids were saying. The pain of that experience drew him to animation; it was easier to draw people than talk to them. Even now, he’s apt to create characters who live in treehouses and float away into a wordless dreamscape.<br><br>Docter was concerned that the executive team would find Sadness too glum, too dark. The animators had drawn the character as dowdy, squat, and blue. Why would you place a figure like that at the center of a movie? Who would want to identify with her?<br><br>Throughout this process, Docter had an unlikely ally: Dacher Keltner, an influential University of California, Berkeley, psychology professor. Docter had called in Keltner to educate him and his colleagues on the science of emotions. They became close friends. Keltner’s daughter was suffering the slings and arrows of adolescence at the same time as Docter’s, and the two men bonded over vicarious angst. Keltner taught Docter and his team the functions of each major emotion: Fear keeps you safe. Anger protects you from getting taken advantage of. And Sadness—what does Sadness do?<br><br>Keltner had explained that Sadness triggers compassion. It brings people together. It helps you see just how much your community of quirky Pixar filmmakers means to you.<br><br>The executive team approved the idea, and Docter and his team rewrote the movie—which ultimately won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature and was the highest grossing original film in Pixar history—with Sadness in the starring role.<br><br><br><br>When you first meet Dacher Keltner—who has flowing blond locks; the relaxed, athletic aura of a surfer; and a lighthouse-beam smile—he seems an unlikely ambassador for Sadness. His default state seems more like Joy. He radiates warmth and caring, and has a sincere politician’s gift for seeing and appreciating others. Keltner runs the Berkeley Social Interaction Lab and the Greater Good Science Center, two of the world’s most influential positive psychology labs, where his job is to study the emotional goodies of being alive: wonder, awe, happiness.<br><br>But spend some time with Keltner and you notice that the corners of his eyes turn down like a basset hound’s, and that he describes himself as anxious and melancholic—as a bittersweet type. “Sadness is at the core of who I am,” he tells me. In my book Quiet, I described the research of Harvard psychologist Jerome Kagan and Elaine Aron, which found that 15 to 20 percent of babies inherit a temperament that predisposes them to react more intensely to life’s uncertainty as well as its glory. Keltner considers himself what Kagan would call a born “high-reactive,” or what Aron would call “highly sensitive.”<br><br>Keltner was raised in a wild and starry-eyed 1970s household. His father was a firefighter and painter who took him to art museums and taught him Taoism, his mother a literature professor who read him Romantic poetry and was especially fond of D. H. Lawrence. Keltner and his younger brother, Rolf, who were very close, roamed around nature at all hours of the day and night. Their parents encouraged them to figure out their core passions, and to build a life around them.<br><br>But in their quest to experience life in all its intensity, Keltner’s parents moved the family at a dizzying pace: from a small town in Mexico, where he was born in a tiny clinic; to Laurel Canyon, a countercultural California neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills, where they lived next door to Jackson Browne’s pianist and Keltner went to second grade at a school called Wonderland; to a rural farm town in the Sierra foothills, where few of his fifth-grade classmates were destined for college. By the time the family arrived in Nottingham, England, when Keltner was in high school, his parents’ marriage had imploded. His father fell in love with the wife of a family friend; his mother started traveling back and forth to Paris to study experimental theater. Keltner and Rolf, left on their own, got drunk and threw parties. They were never a foursome again.<br><br>On the outside Keltner seemed—seems still—like a golden child. But the abrupt shattering had what he describes as a “long, enduring sad effect” on him and his family. His father mostly disappeared; his mother became clinically depressed; Keltner suffered three years of full-blown panic attacks. Rolf, who would grow up to be a dedicated speech therapist in an impoverished community, and a devoted husband and father, battled the demons of what one physician diagnosed as bipolar disorder: insomnia, binge eating, and regular beer and marijuana to calm his nerves.<br><br>Of all these unravelings, it was Rolf’s struggles that shook Keltner most. Partly because his brother had been his anchor from the time they were small: In every neighborhood into which they crash-landed, they were boon companions, fellow explorers of the new terrain, tennis partners who never lost a doubles match. When the family fell apart, they fended for themselves, together.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	18.48,	28,	0,	'Crown (April 5, 2022)',	'English',	'352 pages',	'1.2 pounds',	'6.43 x 1.24 x 9.52 inches',	'05f70e55fc1062381dc50d3a5fc6c02140a4d1e6.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

It works as an introduction to diversity without being explicitly about that, which is a gloriously refreshing take on the universality of the human experience. Young readers can look at the full-page color cartoon drawings for true-to-life representation of people in everyday group situations, such as a public swimming pool, the park, dance class, movie theater, and public transit. Displayed is a richly detailed tapestry of people with many skin tones, hair colors, shapes and sizes, clothing choices, and abilities; examples include wheelchairs, a hijab swimsuit, prosthetics on adults and kids, diabetics with insulin pumps, etc. More importantly, in a book about body positivity, the drawings represent people as they are in real life, \"tall, short, wide, or narrow.\" The approach to both body image and body concepts is to use people-centric language and imagery that doesn\'t divide along explicit lines. Each spread with its dense drawing of people joined together in a group activity focuses on traits (body shape, skin tone, hair, eyes, faces, etc.) in a repetitive, rhythmic sequence. Feder includes representations of Africans, Asians, Muslims, and whites from small sizes to plus sizes in all positions. This book is an excellent pairing with Todd Parr\'s It\'s Okay To Be Different.

The kids bicker, disrupt, argue, complain, and generally behave as delightfully as any batch of after-school club members. Can Cat Kid inspire them to create well-thought-out, tightly plotted stories and classic comic art? Well-spoiler-no. Instead, after Cat Kid shows them how to come up with ideas, gives them permission to fail, and explains that any way they want to work is perfectly OK, whether it\'s as a team, individually, using photos or drawings, or even in verse, the club kids produce action ninja poop joke sketches, merry mayhem, and cutely morbid comics. These delight the club but cause dad Flippy to flip out and call the doctor. Pilkey never turns his stories into kids-versus-adults conflicts, and in this one, the doctor and the nurse pause to read the comics, laugh their heads off, and reassure Flippy that there\'s nothing wrong with his children. They remind him that adult creators write about death and poop all the time, and admonish him to be more chill. Bright colors and reasonably convincing kid-made comics add to the considerable appeal of this chapter book. Vocabulary stretch words such as vegetarian, ambitious, and, most important, autobiographical are scattered throughout.

She’s also a daughter, foodie, a Korean-American, and a writer who effectively gives voice to grief and complicated mother-daughter relationships. When she was 26, Zauner’s mother was diagnosed with cancer and her memoir, </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Crying in H-Mart</span><span> chronicles the decline of her mother’s health and her own journey in finding her sense of self. It’s through food that Zauner most connected with her fierce and independent mother, and so it follows that the place where she most misses her is in a Korean grocery store. Despite her mother rarely showing affection or vulnerability, Zauner traces her own emotions with such care and insight that it’s impossible not to shed a tear as you realize just how much she truly understood her mother. A powerful memoir that shows just how important it is to accept someone fully for who they are—and loving them just the same. </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">—Al Woodworth, Amazon Book Review</span>  </div>         <h3><span>Review</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR:</span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">The New York Times, Time, </span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">NPR</span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">, Washington Post, Vogue</span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">, </span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">Entertainment Weekly,</span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">Good Morning America,</span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\"> Philadelphia Inquirer, Goodreads,</span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">BuzzFeed</span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">,</span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">and more </span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">•</span><span class=\"a-text-bold\"> One of President Obama\'s Favorite Books of the Year </span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">•</span><span class=\"a-text-bold\"> One of The Smithsonian\'s Ten Best Books About Food of the Year</span><span><br><br>“Michelle Zauner has written a book you experience with all of your senses: sentences you can taste, paragraphs that sound like music.

We’d drive the last few blocks to school, and she’d scrub off the gummy film with a coin on the dashboard.<br> <br>“You had a poop dream, didn’t you?”<br> <br>“Umma won ten dollars!” she’d say. “I couldn’t tell you because then it doesn’t work!”<br> <br>Dreams about pigs, the president, or shaking hands with a celebrity were all good-luck<br>dreams—but it was shit in particular, especially if you touched it, that was license to gamble.<br>Every time I had a dream about shit, I couldn’t wait to ask my mom to buy me a scratch card. I’d wake up from a dream about accidentally shitting my pants or walking into a public bathroom to find some extraordinarily long, winding shit, and when it was time to drive to school I’d sit quietly in the passenger seat, hardly able to contain myself until we were a block away from the<br>7-Eleven on Willamette Street.<br> <br>“Mom, pull over,” I’d say. “I’ll tell you why later.”<br> <br>Shortly after we returned to the States, I started having recurring dreams about my mother. I’d suffered one such episode before, when I was a paranoid kid, morbidly obsessed with my par­ents’ deaths. My father is driving us across Ferry Street Bridge and to skirt traffic up ahead, he maneuvers the car onto the shoulder, weaving through a gap under construction and aiming to vault off the bridge onto a platform below. Eyes focused on the mark, he leans in close to the steering wheel and accelerates, but we miss the landing by several feet. The car plunges into the rushing current of the Willamette River and I wake up breathing heavily.<br> <br>Later, when we were teenagers, Nicole told me a story she’d heard from her mother about a woman who suffered from recur­ring nightmares that all revolved around the same car accident. The dreams were so vivid and traumatic that she sought a therapist to help her overcome them. “What if, after the accident, you try to get somewhere,” the therapist suggested. “Maybe if you try to get yourself to a hospital or some kind of safe place, the dream will reach a natural conclusion.” So each night the woman began to will herself out of the car and crawl further and further along the side of the highway. But the dream kept coming back. One day the woman really did get into a car accident and was supposedly found dragging herself across the asphalt in an attempt to reach some nebulous location, unable to distinguish reality from her lucid dreaming.<br> <br>The dreams about my mother had small variations, but ulti­mately they were always the same. My mother would appear, still alive but incapacitated, left behind someplace we had forgotten her.<br> <br>In one I’m alone, sitting on a well-manicured lawn on a warm, sunny day. In the distance I can see a dark and ominous glass house. It looks modern, the exterior made up entirely of black glass windows connected by silver steel frames. The building is wide, mansion-like, and sectioned off in squares, like several monochro­matic Rubik’s Cubes stacked next to and on top of one another. I leave my patch of grass, making my way toward the curious house. I open its heavy door. Inside, it is dark and sparse. I wander around, eventually making my way toward the basement. I run my hand along the side of the wall as I descend the staircase. It is clean and quiet. I find my mother lying in the center of the room. Her eyes are closed and she is resting on some kind of platform that’s not quite a table but not a bed either, a kind of low pedestal, like the one where Snow White sleeps off the poisoned apple. When I reach her, my mother opens her eyes and smiles, as if she’s been waiting for me to find her. She is frail and bald, still sick but alive. At first I feel guilty—that we gave up on her too soon, that she’d been here the whole time. How had we managed to get so con­fused? Then I’m flooded with relief.<br> <br>“We thought you were dead!” I say.<br> <br>“I’ve just been here all along,” she says back to me.<br> <br>I lay my head on her chest and she rests her hand on my head. I can smell her and feel her and everything seems so real. Even<br>though I know she is sick and we will have to lose her again, I’m just so happy to discover that she is alive. I tell her to wait for me. I need to run and get Dad! Then, just as I begin to ascend the stairs to find him, I wake up.<br> <br>In another dream, she arrives at a rooftop dinner party and reveals she’s been living in the house next door all along. In another, I am walking around my parents’ property. I amble down a hill, skidding on the thick clay toward the man-made pond. In the field below, I discover my mother lying alone in a nightgown surrounded by lush grass and wildflowers. Relief again. How silly we were to think you were gone! How on earth did we manage to make such a monu­mental error? When you’re here you’re here you’re here!<br> <br>Always she is bald and chapped and weak and I must carry her to bring her back into the house and show her to my father, but as soon as I bend down to scoop her into my arms, I wake up devas­tated. I shut my eyes immediately and try to crawl my way back to her. Drift back to sleep and return to the dream, savor just a bit more time in her presence. But I’m stuck wide awake or I fall into another dream entirely.<br> <br>Was this my mother’s way of visiting me? Was she trying to tell me something? I felt foolish indulging in mysticism and so I kept the dreams hidden, privately analyzing their possible meanings. If dreams were hidden wishes, why couldn’t I dream of my mother the way I wanted? Why was it that whenever she appeared she was still sick, as if I could not remember her the way she’d been before? I wondered if my memory was stunted, if my dreams were consigned to the epoch of trauma, the image of my mother stuck where we had left off. Had I forgotten her when she was beautiful?<br> <br>After the honeymoon, Peter and I posted up at his parents’ place in Bucks County. During the day we updated our résumés, applied for jobs, and looked at apartments online. I attacked these tasks with abandon. I’d essentially spent the last year as an unpaid nurse and cleaner, and the five years before that failing to make it as a musician. I needed to commit myself to some kind of career as soon as possible.<br> <br>I applied indiscriminately to what seemed like every available office job in New York City and messaged everyone I knew in search of potential leads. By the end of the first week I was hired as a sales assistant for an advertising company in Williamsburg. They had long-term leases on nearly a hundred walls around Brook­lyn and Manhattan, and an in-house art department that hand-painted mural advertisements like they did in the fifties. My job was to assist the two main account reps, helping them sell walls to prospective clients. If we were going after a yoga clothing company, I created maps that pinpointed every Vinyasa studio and organic health food store within a five-block radius. If we were pitching to a skate shoe company, I charted skate parks and concert venues to determine which of our walls in Brooklyn men between eighteen and thirty were most likely to pass by. My salary was forty-five grand a year with benefits. I felt like a millionaire.<br> <br>We rented a railroad apartment in Greenpoint from an old Pol­ish woman who’d acquired half her husband’s real estate in their divorce. The kitchen was small, with little counter space, and the floor was peel-and-stick checkerboard vinyl. There was no sink in the bathroom, just a large farmhouse-style sink in the kitchen that pulled double duty.<br> <br>For the most part, I felt very well adjusted. Everything was so unfamiliar—a new big city to live in, a real grown-up job. I tried my best not to dwell on what could not be changed and to throw myself into productivity, but every so often I was plagued by flashbacks. Painful loops would flare up, bringing every memory I had hoped to repress inescapably to the forefront of my mind.<br>Images of my mother’s white, milky tongue, the purple bedsores, her heavy head slipping from my hands, her eyes falling open. An internal scream, ricocheting off the walls of my chest cavity, rip­ping through my body without release.<br> <br>I tried therapy. Once a week after work I took the L train to Union Square and attempted to explain what I was feeling, though generally I was unable to take my mind off the ticking clock until half an hour in, when time was already up. Then I’d take the train back to Bedford Avenue and walk the half hour back to our apart­ment. It was hardly therapeutic and seemed just to exhaust me even more. Nothing my therapist said was anything I hadn’t psy­choanalyzed in myself a million times already anyway. I was paying a hundred-dollar copay per session, and I began to think it would be much more fulfilling to just take myself out for a fifty-dollar lunch twice a week. I canceled the rest of my sessions and commit­ted myself to exploring alternative forms of self-care.<br> <br>I decided to turn to a familiar friend—Maangchi, the YouTube vlogger who had taught me how to cook doenjang jjigae and jatjuk in my time of need. Each day after work, I prepared a new recipe from her catalog. Sometimes, I followed her step by step, carefully measuring, pausing, and rewinding to get it exactly right. Other times, I picked a dish, refamiliarized myself with the ingredients, and let the video play in the background as my hands and taste buds took over from memory.<br> <br>Every dish I cooked exhumed a memory. Every scent and taste brought me back for a moment to an unravaged home. Knife-cut noodles in chicken broth took me back to lunch at Myeongdong Gyoja after an afternoon of shopping, the line so long it filled a flight of stairs, extended out the door, and wrapped around the building. The kalguksu so dense from the rich beef stock and starchy noodles it was nearly gelatinous. My mother ordering more and more refills of their famously garlic- heavy kimchi. My aunt scolding her for blowing her nose in public.<br> <br>Crispy Korean fried chicken conjured bachelor nights with Eunmi. Licking oil from our fingers as we chewed on the crispy skin, cleansing our palates with draft beer and white radish cubes as she helped me with my Korean homework. Black- bean noodles summoned Halmoni slurping jjajangmyeon takeout, huddled around a low table in the living room with the rest of my Korean family.<br> <br>I drained an entire bottle of oil into my Dutch oven and deep- fried pork cutlets dredged in flour, egg, and panko for tonkotsu, a Japanese dish my mother used to pack in my lunch boxes. I spent hours squeezing the water from boiled bean sprouts and tofu and spooning filling into soft, thin dumpling skins, pinching the tops closed, each one slightly closer to one of Maangchi’s perfectly uniform mandu.<br> <br>Maangchi peeled the skin off an Asian pear with the giant knife pulled toward her, just like Mom did when she cut Fuji apples for me after school on a little red cutting board, before eating the left-over fruit from the core. Just like Mom, chopsticks in one hand, scissors in the other, cutting galbi and cold naengmyeon noodles with a specifically Korean ambidextrous precision. Skillfully stretching out the meat with her right hand and cutting it into bite-sized pieces with her left, using kitchen scissors like a warrior brandishes a weapon.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	15.95,	26.95,	0,	'Knopf; First Edition (April 20, 2021)',	'English',	'256 pages',	'15.4 ounces',	'5.76 x 1.12 x 8.54 inches',	'871da09baa9ee975e2e65fb1b4ab3a448ab4599c.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">The Moment and the Myths</span><span><br><br>the moment the universe put the Roosevelt quote in front of me, three lessons came into sharp focus. The first one is what I call “the physics of vulnerability.” It’s pretty simple: If we are brave enough often enough, we will fall. Daring is not saying “I’m willing to risk failure.” Daring is saying “I know I will eventually fail, and I’m still all in.” I’ve never met a brave person who hasn’t known disappointment, failure, even heartbreak.<br><br>Second, the Roosevelt quote captures everything I’ve learned about vulnerability. The definition of vulnerability as the emotion that we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure first emerged in my work two decades ago, and has been validated by every study I’ve done since, including this research on leadership. Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome.<br><br>We’ve asked thousands of people to describe vulnerability to us over the years, and these are a few of the answers that directly pierce the emotion: the first date after my divorce, talking about race with my team, trying to get pregnant after my second miscarriage, starting my own business, watching my child leave for college, apologizing to a colleague about how I spoke to him in a meeting, sending my son to orchestra practice knowing how badly he wants to make first chair and knowing there’s a really good chance he will not make the orchestra at all, waiting for the doctor to call back, giving feedback, getting feedback, getting fired, firing someone.<br><br>Across all of our data there’s not a shred of empirical evidence that vulnerability is weakness.<br><br>Are vulnerable experiences easy? No.<br><br>Can they make us feel anxious and uncertain? Yes.<br><br>Do they make us want to self-protect? Always.<br><br>Does showing up for these experiences with a whole heart and no armor require courage? Absolutely.<br><br>The third thing I learned has turned into a mandate by which I live: If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback. There are a million cheap seats in the world today filled with people who will never be brave with their lives but who will spend every ounce of energy they have hurling advice and judgment at those who dare greatly. Their only contributions are criticism, cynicism, and fearmongering. If you’re criticizing from a place where you’re not also putting yourself on the line, I’m not interested in what you have to say.<br><br>We have to avoid the cheap-seats feedback and stay armor-free. The research participants who do both of those well have one hack in common: Get clear on whose opinions of you matter.<br><br>We need to seek feedback from those people. And even if it’s really hard to hear, we must bring it in and hold it until we learn from it. This is what the research taught me:<br><br>Don’t grab hurtful comments and pull them close to you by rereading them and ruminating on them. Don’t play with them by rehearsing your badass comeback. And whatever you do, don’t pull hatefulness close to your heart.<br><br>Let what’s unproductive and hurtful drop at the feet of your unarmored self. And no matter how much your self-doubt wants to scoop up the criticism and snuggle with the negativity so it can confirm its worst fears, or how eager the shame gremlins are to use the hurt to fortify your armor, take a deep breath and find the strength to leave what’s mean-spirited on the ground. You don’t even need to stomp it or kick it away. Cruelty is cheap, easy, and chickenshit. It doesn’t deserve your energy or engagement. Just step over the comments and keep daring, always remembering that armor is too heavy a price to pay to engage with cheap-seat feedback.<br><br>Again, if we shield ourselves from all feedback, we stop growing. If we engage with all feedback, regardless of the quality and intention, it hurts too much, and we will ultimately armor up by pretending it doesn’t hurt, or, worse yet, we’ll disconnect from vulnerability and emotion so fully that we stop feeling hurt. When we get to the place that the armor is so thick that we no longer feel anything, we experience a real death. We’ve paid for self-protection by sealing off our heart from everyone, and from everything—not just hurt, but love.<br><br>No one captures the consequences of choosing that level of self-protection over love better than C. S. Lewis:<br><br>To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. <br><br>To love is to be vulnerable.<br><br>Rumble Tool: The Square Squad<br><br>When we define ourselves by what everyone thinks, it’s hard to be brave. When we stop caring about what anyone thinks, we’re too armored for authentic connection. So how do we get clear on whose opinions of us matter?<br><br>Here’s the solution we shared in Daring Greatly: Get a one-inch by one-inch piece of paper and write down the names of the people whose opinions of you matter. It needs to be small because it forces you to edit. Fold it and put it in your wallet. Then take ten minutes to reach out to those people—your square squad—and share a little gratitude. You can keep it simple: I’m getting clear on whose opinions matter to me. Thank you for being one of those people. I’m grateful that you care enough to be honest and real with me.<br><br>If you need a rubric for choosing the people, here’s the best I have: The people on your list should be the people who love you not despite your vulnerability and imperfections, but because of them.<br><br>The people on your list should not be “yes” people. This is not the suck-up squad. They should be people who respect you enough to rumble with the vulnerability of saying “I think you were out of your integrity in that situation, and you need to clean it up and apologize. I’ll be here to support you through that.” Or “Yes, that was a huge setback, but you were brave and I’ll dust you off and cheer you on when you go back into the arena.”<br><br>The Four Six Myths of Vulnerability<br><br>In </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Daring Greatly</span><span>, I wrote about four myths surrounding vulnerability, but since I’ve brought the courage-building work into organizations and have been doing it with leaders, the data have spoken, and there are clearly six misguided myths that persist across wide variables including gender, age, race, country, ability and culture.<br><br>Myth #1: Vulnerability is weakness.<br><br>It used to take me a long time to dispel the myths that surround vulnerability, especially the myth that vulnerability is weakness. But in 2014, standing across from several hundred military special forces soldiers on a base in the Midwest, I decided to stop evangelizing, and I nailed my argument with a single question.<br><br>I looked at these brave soldiers and said, “Vulnerability is the emotion that we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. Can you give me a single example of courage that you’ve witnessed in another soldier or experienced in your own life that did not require experiencing vulnerability?”<br><br>Complete silence. Crickets.<br><br>Finally, a young man spoke up. He said, “No, ma’am. Three tours. I can’t think of a single act of courage that doesn’t require managing massive vulnerability.”<br><br>I’ve asked that question now a couple of hundred times in meeting rooms across the globe. I’ve asked fighter pilots and software engineers, teachers and accountants, CIA agents and CEOs, clergy and professional athletes, artists and activists, and not one person has been able to give me an example of courage without vulnerability. The weakness myth simply crumbles under the weight of the data and people’s lived experiences of courage.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	10.39,	28,	0,	'Random House; First Edition (October 9, 2018)',	'English',	'320 pages',	'1.06 pounds',	'5.87 x 1.26 x 8.45 inches',	'49938126bbf5dd46212b4e3a4c730b3969f435d2.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span>The Beginning<br><br>For as long as I can remember, I have loved creating things. When I was little, I would spend countless weekends working on craft projects, making photo collages from magazine cutouts, rearranging my bedroom, or helping my grandma set up for parties. Never was I not doing something. For the longest time, I had always said that I was going to grow up to be a fashion stylist. I loved clothes, but even more than that, I loved putting pieces together to make them pretty. I get this from my nonnie, who taught me all I know about tablescapes, entertaining, and making one heck of a Dutch Baby (page 29). It wasn’t until I was fourteen or fifteen that I started to get into cooking, but once I started, I never stopped . . . clearly. <br><br>Let me back up. I am one of seven kids. Yes, I did say seven, and yes, we all have the same mom and dad. For most of my life, I was the only girl of the bunch—my little sister, Asher, wasn’t born until I was fifteen. This meant my early years were spent as one of the biggest tomboys around. Dirt bikes, snowboarding, swimming in the lake. My mom put me in cute dresses and hats, but I wanted nothing to do with them. When she picked me up from preschool, I’d hop in the van and immediately whip off my pretty clothes (I know, I know, so wild). I’d strip down to the boxers and tee I wore underneath, just like my brothers, and breathe a sigh of relief. <br><br>Growing up in such a big family meant a lot of things. My life was not only fun; it was also never boring. It was hectic, unorganized, and, um, very loud. I am the only person in my family who loves a good routine, loves to be organized, and basically just hates all things chaotic. My mom, on the other hand, thrives on chaos. While I love her to pieces and she is my best friend, we could not be more different. She is an adventure-seeking, go-with-the-flow, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kind of person. Me, I’m a routine-loving, type A, crazy-focused freak. As a kid, it bugged me greatly that every single day in our house was chaotic. It bugged me even more that our dinners were about five times more frenzied than my friends’. I had this picture in my head of the perfect family dinner. You know, where everyone sits down together at a beautifully set table, at a reasonable hour, and eats like civilized people. I blame this perfectly concocted scene on the TV show </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">7th Heaven</span><span>, which I watched religiously (along with Gilmore Girls, which I proudly admit I still watch reruns of). For the most part, </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">7th Heaven</span><span> depicted a large family like mine. But they all sat down for dinner at a normal hour, ate a home-cooked meal, and discussed life as if they were actually normal human beings. That’s what I wanted, and I wanted it so bad. <br><br>My dad worked a full-time job as a bond broker, and after work he would head to the gym to play handball. When my mom was pregnant with me, with three crazy little boys in tow, my parents made a deal that Dad could go play handball after work every day if he’d take care of dinner when he got home. The unspoken part of their deal was that if Dad made dinner, Mom made dessert, which most of the time was ready before dinner. <br><br>You see, Dad’s usual hour of arrival home wasn’t until seven thirty or eight, and that was on a good night. Even on school nights we wouldn’t eat until almost nine. (Mom will try to tell you it was earlier, but she’s revised the memory a little bit. It was rarely before nine—ask any of my brothers.) Finally, when I was fourteen or so, I said something along the lines of, “Screw it! You guys are so annoying and I’m over it. I’m making my own freaking dinner!” And that right there is how and why I began cooking. At the time, I was cooking for the sole purpose of helping my dad get dinner on the table before nine p.m. What I soon came to realize is that I really had a lot of fun cooking. I was very much a rule-following kid, but in cooking, I was more carefree and creative. I might have used a recipe as a base, but I never followed it to a T. If I didn’t have something the recipe called for, I used whatever we had on hand and made it work. I was totally comfortable just doing my own thing, never fearful that something wouldn’t turn out. If there’s one thing my dad taught me about cooking, it’s that pretty much anything can be saved with a giant pile of cheese and a handful of fresh basil. <br><br>It wasn’t long before I took over all the cooking for the family. I loved it. I loved searching for recipes, going to the store and picking out ingredients, and, probably most important, I loved having control of something. It felt so good to rein in the chaos and take control of dinnertime. <br><br>My preteen and teenage years were extremely difficult for me. I struggled a lot with anxiety about school. That, on top of the chaos of my family, was really hard for me. Cooking was my own little escape, and it inspired me in a way I didn’t even know I could be inspired. My parents loved the help, too. It was winwin all around. The number one reason I love cooking is the reactions I see on people’s faces when they take that first bite of a delicious dish. My favorite thing ever is watching someone’s eyes roll back and then open wide into an “oh my gosh, this is heaven” look. Those reactions are what I live for, they’re what keep me cooking and running full speed ahead. <br><br>Fast-forward a few years. I’m eighteen years old, and living in LA, and working for Barbizon, an acting and modeling agency, as a talent agent. I’m in ready-set-go mode, about to start school at the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising, and pumped to begin my life as a fashion stylist, the life I’d been dreaming of since I was little. But after about two months, a case of homesickness kicked in. I freaked out and moved my butt back to Colorado, back to my comfort zone of family and chaos. At the time I was so disappointed in myself, but looking back now, it was without a doubt the best decision I’ve made in my life. The decision to start my blog, </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Half Baked Harvest</span><span>, came as soon as I returned home. I was feeling lost, and my mom convinced me to give something completely different a try. Over the years she had seen how happy cooking made me, so she suggested starting a food blog. Since I really had nothing to lose, I went for it and never looked back. That was when I stepped back out of my comfort zone and left it at the door. For good. <br><br>That decision is why I am sitting here now, writing this cookbook filled with recipes that I am super excited to share with you. That one decision set me up to create a life I love. You know what’s funny, though? The whole reason I even started cooking was because I simply wanted to eat dinner at a normal hour. We all joke now that I eat later than anyone else in the family, and it’s true, but only because I love what I do so much that my workaholic self doesn’t get around to actually eating until pretty late. I now understand the struggle my parents were faced with all those years ago. Life is busy, and dinner is hard to get on the table at a decent hour! But dinner is something that shouldn’t be rushed. It’s a time to relax with loved ones at the end of the day when work is done.<br><br>Cooking changed me, and my work changed me. I’m not the same timid, fearful, routine-loving person I used to be. Creating recipes for others to share with friends and family has brought me so much happiness! My hope for this cookbook is that it becomes a staple in your kitchen. I want it to be the book that has pasta sauce on the cover and chocolate smeared across the dessert pages, that automatically opens to your most favorite recipe because that’s how often you make it. I want this book to be your go-to. <br><br>As you will see, these recipes are inspired by the people and places I love most. I talk a lot about my family, as they truly are my favorite people in the world. My parents and each of my siblings have inspired these recipes in their own special way. My philosophy on food—be bright, beautiful, and positively cozy. My philosophy on life—work harder than anyone else.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	24.49,	29.99,	0,	'Clarkson Potter; Illustrated edition (September 12, 2017)',	'English',	'304 pages',	'2.78 pounds',	'8.31 x 0.96 x 10.27 inches',	'76832c5e8f8a8fc465b8af441cc8bfe90b32f41b.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

Crazy as it may be, my family recently grew, and I’m now one of EIGHT kids! My littlest brother, Oslo, arrived in 2020, and he is the greatest thing that came out of that whole year. While most of my siblings are scattered all over the place now, I’m still up in the mountains of Colorado. I live in a renovated log horse barn steps away from our separate studio barn, where I cook and shoot photos and generally stay busy. A lot of days, I’m on my feet all day cooking and testing new recipes. Other days, I race against the setting sun to get photographs of the finished dishes. And then there are the days I huddle in front of my pizza oven to keep cozy while catching up on emails and calls.<br><br>I do all this with my family just next door, which I love. They LOVE food, always have, and they are what started my cooking and keep me cooking—if only because they are constantly hungry! My little sister, Asher, and my brothers (whenever they roll through town) are constantly popping into the studio looking for something to eat. Somehow, no matter how busy I am, I can’t resist stopping what I’m doing to make them their favorite foods—that’s just what you do for the people you love! <br><br>But when my schedule overfills and stress sets in, taking care of myself is usually the first thing to go. And I bet the same is true for you. But it doesn’t have to be! No matter what else is going on, we all need to eat—every single day. <br><br>Food is, quite literally, fuel for life. So sometimes you need a quick sheet pan meal thrown together from whatever’s on hand, while other times you can leisurely enjoy both the cooking process and the meal. Sometimes you crave a clean, light, nutrientpacked dish, while other times you just want a big plate of something comforting. For me, the days are all different, but one thing is constant: I always want to be sure my loved ones and I are eating well.  <br><br>To me, “eating well” means not only sustaining your body but also giving yourself what you feel you need. I am definitely NOT an expert on any sort of healthy eating. What I have learned, though, is that I care about how food makes me feel, but I don’t want to spend a lot of time stressing about it. I want to know where my food came from, what’s in it, and who made it. I want to feel good about what I eat without sacrificing flavor or overcomplicating the process. And that’s the approach I take in my cooking every single day: I aim to make food that is delicious, usually healthy, sometimes decadent, and always satisfying.  <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">what “balance” means to me </span><span><br><br>We’re always hearing about the importance of “balanced meals.” I don’t disagree, but if you’re looking for rules and regulations on health, I’m afraid you’re in the wrong place. I’m not a nutritionist, and I would never want to tell you how you “should” be eating. For me, feel-good food is not about caloriecounting or restriction. But it IS about lots of flavor and satisfaction. That means cooking with plenty of good fat, reducing sugar when possible—or using natural sweeteners like honey, dates, and maple syrup—and, most important, using non-processed ingredients that are whole and real. The other piece I feel is equally important is to give my body what it wants. Some days that’s a heaping plate of hearty, well-seasoned, yummy vegetables, and some days it’s a bowl of cheesy, buttery, gooey noodles. That’s what balance is for me. <br><br>I set out to create a book that embodies the way I eat. I also wanted to give you guys more of what you’ve been asking for: the “healthy-ish” recipes I usually share on the blog at the start of each year. You—and I—want to eat those sorts of meals throughout the year, too, so I wanted to share more of them here. But my biggest hope is no matter what you’re looking for on any particular day, you will find something here that works for you. Whatever you’re feeling, that you can flip through the pages and find something super satisfying. And, of course, that some of these recipes will be on repeat in your kitchen! <br><br>I’ve organized the recipes by types of meals and ingredients. Some dishes are lightened-up versions of old favorites. Others are heavy on superfoods. If you’re all about clean living, that’s here. And if you just NEED chocolate cake, that’s here, too. (Spoiler alert: it’s really good . . .) Whenever possible, I’ve indicated where you can make a choice of ingredients. There’s tons of flexibility here, and you should feel empowered to make the decision that works for you. I do a lot of cooking “research” on my family—some of my most popular recipes have come from Creighton’s insane imagination or whatever Red is craving. They are all picky in their own ways, and believe it or not, so am I. So it’s very important for my recipes to be flexible and fun. Maybe the way I prepared a dish isn’t exactly how you want to eat it that day—that’s okay! You can leave out the cheese, use gluten-free pasta, add in more greens, or do whatever else sounds good. I’ve also given multiple options for how to cook some things, especially when it comes to the slow cooker and pressure cooker, since I know we don’t all have them (but those of us who do LOVE them).</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	19.42,	29.99,	0,	'Clarkson Potter (March 29, 2022)',	'English',	'288 pages',	'2.75 pounds',	'8.29 x 0.96 x 10.26 inches',	'7be940084083ccb7b67b6753788a47edf196c5ca.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span>INTRODUCTION<br><br> I come from a family of nine—and a big family means big meals. In an effort to control some of our mealtime chaos and get dinner on the table before ten p.m., when I was thirteen years old, I began to help my dad with the cooking. Within a few months, I was cooking dinner for the entire family every single night—I loved it immediately. I have always been a creative person, so I started expressing my artistic side through cooking. I had fun dreaming up my own recipes, experimenting with new types of cuisines and ingredients, and putting my own twist on classics. At nineteen, I decided to capture the process in photographs and began to document my favorite recipes on Half Baked Harvest. I had no idea what I was doing at the time, but fast-forward several years and Half Baked Harvest has become a full-time career that keeps me extremely busy. In fact, my mom, my dad, and one of my brothers work for the company!<br><br> When I first started out, I was young, still living in my parents’ house, and I had all the time in the world to spend in the kitchen creating elaborate recipes. But I’ve had to adapt to a much busier lifestyle. My life now encompasses so much more than recipe development and photography. There’s travel, management of my team, and the demands of trying to grow the business. Like most everyone else in the world, I need simple, quick, everyday recipes that come together in a flash but still taste delicious. As my own cooking began to veer more into the territory of simplicity, I began sharing them and—surprise, surprise—they quickly became pretty darn popular.<br><br> I’m willing to bet you’re just as busy as I am, if not more so. The first thing to go when life gets hectic is meal planning and cooking, right? You get home at the end of the day, you didn’t plan ahead, you don’t have what you need, and you’re too tired to think. Well, I’m going to help you with all of that. In fact, this idea was born solely from the feedback I received from you guys. Your emails, Instagram messages, and comments on Half Baked Harvest said it loud and clear: more recipes that are delicious but EASY, too. This book is exactly that: my go-to super simple recipes. My purpose in creating Half Baked Harvest has always been to help readers get into the kitchen and create tasty, healthy(ish) recipes any day of the week. This cookbook is another tool for you to do just that.<br><br> ABOUT THIS BOOK<br><br> Here\'s what you need to know. Within this cookbook I’m sharing some of my favorite recipes. They are flavorful, colorful, and easy. Some of them are healthy . . . and some have a good amount of cheese. It’s all about balance.<br><br> Just because these recipes are super simple does not mean they lack flavor. While these recipes are straightforward enough for everyday cooking, they do not fall exclusively into the ten-ingredients-or-fewer and made-in-under-thirty-minutes categories—though there are plenty of both! Flavor has always been and will always be paramount to me. Of course, I want to share the easiest version of a recipe, but I will not sacrifice taste to make a dish with only five ingredients. That said, some of the recipes included here have more than ten ingredients and some take longer than thirty minutes, but that doesn’t mean the recipe is not “super simple.” If you can throw ingredients into a slow cooker, use an Instant Pot, dump them all in one skillet, or simply pick up a few items from the grocery store to assemble something quick, you can handle these recipes. You’ll definitely be adding these recipes to your weeknight lineup.<br><br> You can, of course, still expect all my special “Tieghan touches,” which can range from including an unexpected ingredient or garnishing with herbs or edible flowers. I’m still me—I’m just shorter on time! The extra flourishes not working for you? Skip ’em! Really, you have my permission. Making recipes beautiful and pleasing to the eye is what I’m all about—it’s a priority for me—but, please, take or leave these “extras” as you wish! (I will say, though, if you are looking to up your Instagram game, an edible flower or two is always a good start.)<br><br>I’ve organized the book by types of meals and popular main ingredients: breakfast, appetizers and sides, salad and soup, pizza and pasta, vegetarian, poultry and pork, meat, seafood, and last (but certainly not least, not here!) dessert. So, all your basic and most loved food groups, right? I have also included a chapter on my favorite super simple basic recipes because homemade still tastes better—and making meals from scratch doesn’t have to be difficult or a time suck. On these pages, you’ll find slow cooker dinners, Instant Pot recipes, one pan goodness, recipes made with exclusively pantry staple ingredients, recipes with fewer than ten ingredients (not including salt, pepper, or olive oil), recipes that take thirty minutes or less, and some of my best tips and tricks for easy cooking. Whenever possible, I have given slow cooker, pressure cooker, and stovetop options to make the recipes completely adaptable for your needs. Look for the icons at the right throughout the recipe pages.<br><br> There is something for everyone here . . . and a photo to go along with it, too.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	18.27,	29.99,	0,	'Clarkson Potter (October 29, 2019)',	'English',	'288 pages',	'2.65 pounds',	'8.23 x 0.95 x 10.26 inches',	'7338502aae901a71ea6f83c34af5cc9cdabbfc17.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">Introduction<br></span><span><br><br>When I was growing up in Austin, Texas, my mom and I spent a lot of time watching cooking shows. I’d stretch out on the hideous gold plaid sofa in front of our rear-projection big-screen TV (that took up half of the living room) and Mom would watch from the kitchen, usually while sweeping the floor with one of the superior Mexican brooms she’d buy across the border and bring home. <br><br>We loved</span><span class=\"a-text-italic\"> Two Fat Ladies </span><span>on the BBC and</span><span class=\"a-text-italic\"> Emeril Live</span><span>, but our favorite show was Diana Kennedy ’s. We’d watch her make chorizo with green and red chiles from a mercado in Michoacán, and were deeply envious of her sundrenched kitchen full of red clay bowls. It all just seemed so magical. And dammit, I wanted all of those things, too! I decided then and there that I would grow up to be just like her. <br><br>Now I know that this desire was masking a deeper one: the desire to understand myself. Sure, part of me wanted the ego recognition of being “the best” or “the authority,” but what was so devastating to me as a Mexican American boy growing up in Texas was that she knew more about my culture and my people than I did. That a British woman and Rick Bayless, a white man from Oklahoma, got to represent the culinary diversity of México while my Mexican American family tried to enculturate with meatloaf and Chef Boyardee. <br><br>My gread-grandfather Andrés Castruita was a dairy farmer in Torreón, a city in the northern state of Coahuila. He sold his farm in 1910, moved his family, including my five-yearold grandfather Agustín Flores Castruita, across the border and bought a small farm just south of Austin. Even though my grandfather only spent the first five years of his life in México, somehow, he was able to hold on to it—from the intense sea-green color of his house to his embellished style of handwriting to the mariachi songs he’d sing when he drank. I didn’t know at the time how Mexican all these things were, but in the years since, as I’ve explored the country myself, I’ve recognized them all. To this day, I’m not sure how he picked them up from such a young age. <br><br>Agustín would grow up in Austin, eventually marry and have five children, the first of whom was my mom, Gloria. While he wasn’t the best father in the world (he had a tendency to play favorites), he was a good grandfather. He liked me, probably because I looked like him. I have a lot of the Castruita features, but more important, I am dark, like he was. My mom, dad, and brother are all light-complected. When I was born, the nurse who delivered me said to my mom, “Gloria, your baby has a tan!” <br><br>From that moment on, I was different. I didn’t want to be, but I had no choice. I was brown, and in Texas in the 1970s that meant you were labeled Mexican. Neither of those things—being brown and being Mexican—was bad to me, but to many of the parents, students, and teachers at the all-white preschool and elementary school in a small town south of Austin (where I was the first Mexican American to attend and my younger brother was the second), they were bad. So my parents decided not to teach us Spanish as kids because they were worried we’d develop accents and would be made fun of or be held back in school as a result. <br><br>When I was in first grade, the school administration tried to put me in the free-lunch program. Both my parents worked; we were middle class; we had a swimming pool and lake property. But the assumption was that I needed it. When I was in second grade, the PTA tried to start a coat collection for me. I had two coats; they were new and both fit well. I didn’t need more coats. But the assumption was that I needed it. When I was in third grade, my homeroom teacher asked the class what we wanted to be when we grew up. I eagerly raised my hand and said I wanted to be President of the United States. The little boy who sat next to me looked me in the eye. “You can’t be President,” he said. “You’re not white.” I was so confused. I didn’t understand. I went home that night and asked my parents and they said he was wrong; as an American-born citizen, I had every right to be president. But that eight-yearold boy was taught that I couldn’t be. Someone he trusted said those words to him. And his assumption was that I needed to hear them.<br><br> Back when my parents bought their first home in Austin in 1963, the neighborhood association called a vote on whether to allow them, a Mexican American couple, into the community or not. Eleven years later, they were forced to finance their second home on their own because no mortgage company would lend money to a Mexican American family wanting to build a custom-home in an all-white suburb. Texas was a brutal place for people of color. <br><br>As I grew older, my mom started to explore her own identity. We took weekend trips across the border to an unassuming little town called Nuevo Progresso, about five hours from Austin. My mom loved it, and I would later fall for Nuevo Progresso as well. It only had one paved street, but it was there that I got to experience for myself the vibrant mercados I’d only ever seen on Diana Kennedy’s and Rick Bayless’s shows. Whole animals from farms five miles away would arrive in the morning, get butchered onsite, and be sold fresh to people who would go home and cook the meat that afternoon. At the comida corrida stalls, the mercado version of fast food, there was such an immediacy to the connections people had to one another, from farmers and ranchers to cooks and eaters. <br><br>My mom was taken by the spices and dried chiles she found there. At a time when everyone, even Mexican Americans, were using chili powder (used to flavor the dish of the same name), canned sauces, and jarred moles, she experimented with chiles anchos, pasillas, and guajillos. My aunts saw it as the equivalent of churning your own butter; if you had access to McCormick’s, why would you take the time to buy a whole dried chile, reconstitute it, and puree it? But as you’ll see in the recipes that follow, this process is at the very heart of Mexican cuisine, and the flavor is clearly superior. (Try my Birria estilo Aguascalientes on p. 216 and I think you’ll agree.) <br><br>We never talked about it, but I think that during this time my mom was longing for a connection to México and to her heritage. Immigrants and first- and second-generation Mexican Americans often live in two different worlds. One world is wholly white American, where you feel compelled to fit in to the point of sacrificing your own identity. The other is Mexican, which for immigrants is the world you left behind and always miss, but for firstand second-generation Mexican Americans it is the world you don’t fully understand because you are so far removed from it. My mother was first generation, and her food reflected that. <br><br>She learned a lot of what she knew from her mother (who was known for her epic Thanksgiving feasts and the oyster cornbread dressing she’d serve) as well as from the home ec classes that she had to take in high school where she learned classic mid-century American dishes like cheeseballs, fondue, and chicken and dumplings. When she got married she bought the 1963 edition of the </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Betty Crocker Cookbook</span><span> (which I still have to this day) with lobster thermidor and the gelatin molds and the sugar cookies (only Mary’s, never Ethel’s) as well as the complete set of the Time-Life Foods of the World cookbooks. She was passionate about food and loved to cook. <br><br>When she was in the kitchen, she never tasted her food, which drove me crazy when I got to culinary school, where one of the core tenets is to taste as you go. But she had the keenest sense of smell of anyone I have ever known; all she had to do was sniff and she’d know exactly what a dish needed and could balance it perfectly. She’d call in me or my brother or my father at the end and have us taste, only for salt. “Why don’t you try it?” I would ask, and she’d give me that disgusted-but-not-disgusted mom face. “Why would I need to?” <br><br>Above all, my mom cooked to express her love. The biggest insult you could ever give her was to not like her food. In the thirty-nine years that I knew her, there were probably only two times I didn’t like what she made. (Sorry, but nobody needs salmon croquettes made with canned salmon.) <br><br>My mom is the reason that I cook. When I was four years old, I would push a chair to the kitchen, climb up, and stir the pots simmering on the stove. I’d watch her and learn. When I was in sixth grade, she took two weeks off of work during my winter break so we could learn how to make tamales together. She had only ever seen her aunts and her mother make them, all of whom had died by that point. There was no one in our family who could pass the recipe down, so she decided to restart the tradition and pass it to her sons.</span>  </div>      </div>                                 </div>',	28.99,	35,	0,	'Clarkson Potter (May 3, 2022)',	'English',	'304 pages',	'2.85 pounds',	'8.52 x 1 x 10.3 inches',	'021d7cc2cc67d1de40a12a16548990e5804b28cc.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">Suya</span><span><br><br>Suya is the grandfather of American BBQ. In Nigeria, the spices draw out and fire up the meats, often cooked over an open flame. Here I do the same. But if you don’t have a grill, use a well-oiled cast-iron skillet over high heat in a kitchen with open windows. The open windows are very important, unless you find the blare of a smoke alarm harmonious and enjoy fits of sneezing. I find the sweetness of the char plus the heat of the spice totally irresistible. I did when I first smelled it from beyond the walls of my grandfather’s compound in Nigeria, or when we went to market when I could sneak a skewer. (Since my grandfather was an obi, or chief, there were many customs and rules around what he and his family could eat.) When I opened my second restaurant, Kith and Kin, I wanted to suya everything. The reaction from the diners, at least initially, was mixed. Many Nigerians scoffed at the idea that suya could be applied to, for instance, brussels sprouts. They were, on the whole, proud that Nigerian cuisine was being given the attention it so much deserved but arrived at the table with some strong opinions. Judging from the empty bowls that came back to the kitchen, I think I won them over. But it was always a battle.<br><br>In this recipe, I stick to the traditional proteins—steak, chicken, and shrimp. In Nigeria, suya is served with sliced tomatoes and onions, which help mellow the heat. Here that role is played by a tomato-ginger soubise and a traditional onion cream sauce from France, and I keep the tomatoes and onions in the form of pickles, whose burst of acidity rounds out the flavors.<br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">For the suya</span><span><br>Place the shrimp, steak, and chicken in three separate bowls. Season each with 1 1/2 tablespoons of suya spice and 1/2 teaspoon salt, mixing well to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (You can marinate the shrimp for up to 12 hours, and the steak and chicken for up to 48 hours.)<br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\"><br>For the tomato-ginger soubise</span><span> <br>Heat the oven to 400°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Toss the tomatoes with olive oil and season with salt. Spread evenly over the sheet pan and bake for 15 minutes, until deep red and a little wrinkly.<br><br>Meanwhile, heat the grapeseed oil in a medium pot over medium heat. When it shimmers, add the GGP and cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onions and cook until translucent and soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the roasted tomatoes, along with the cream and milk. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until reduced to about 1 cup—watch carefully, as cream has a tendency to boil over, so reduce the heat as necessary to keep it from sputtering or burning— about 1 hour. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, then transfer to a blender and purée until velvety smooth. Season to taste with salt and set aside. You should have 1 cup of soubise.<br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\"><br>For the pickled tomatoes and onions</span><span><br>Bring the spice pickling liquid to a boil in a small pot. Place the onions and tomatoes in a nonreactive bowl and pour the hot liquid over them, stirring to combine well. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour, before serving. You should have about 3 cups of pickled tomatoes and onions.<br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">To assemble</span><span><br>When ready to cook, prepare a grill for high heat. Let it heat for 10 minutes. Grill the shrimp, steak, and chicken, turning occasionally, until deeply browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes for shrimp and steak and 4 to 5 minutes for the chicken.<br><br>In a small pot, warm the soubise over low heat. Place the grilled items on a platter, dust with extra suya spice, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with warm soubise, pickled tomatoes and onions, lime wedges for squeezing, and Jollof Rice.<br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\"><br>Origin:</span><span> Nigeria <br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">Yield:</span><span> 6 to 8 servings<br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\"><br>For the suya and to assemble</span><span><br>1 pound large (16–20 size) shrimp, peeled and deveined<br>1 pound boneless ribeye steak, excess fat trimmed, sliced into 1/4-inch strips<br>1 pound boneless, skinless chickenthighs, sliced into 1/4-inch strips<br>4 1/2 tablespoons Suya Spice (page 8), divided, plus more to garnish<br>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided<br>1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley, to serve<br>Tomato-ginger soubise (below), to serve<br>Pickled tomatoes and onions (below), to serve<br>Limewedges, to serve<br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">For the tomato-ginger soubise</span><span><br>1 Roma tomato, roughly chopped<br>2 teaspoons extra-virgin oliveoil <br>Kosher salt, to taste<br>2 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br>3 tablespoons GGP<br>1 yellow onion, thinly sliced<br>1 cup heavy cream<br>1 cup whole milk<br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">For the pickled tomatoes and onions</span><span><br>1 cup Spice Pickling Liquid<br>1 medium red onion, large dice<br>1 medium ripe tomato, large dice<br><br>Cooked suya shrimp will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, chicken and beef suya for up to 4 days.

From over the walls of his compound drifted intoxicating smells of spice-touched smoked meat called Suya, meat I later learned was marinated in suya spice, also called yaji spice. But due to tradition, which stated that no one from the house of an obi could eat outside the home, my grandfather forbade us from eating from these mai suya, as the vendors are called. It wasn’t until later that I came to fully appreciate the magic this spice mixture, developed by the northern Hausa tribe of Nigeria, works on meat. It is the grandfather of American barbecue. Built around the native ingredients of West Africa—chili pepper, onion, and ground nuts—and layered with the char of an open flame, Nigerian suya is often made with beef or goat. But it turns everything, from duck and chicken to shrimp and even brussels sprouts, into a deeply flavorful, almost irresistible meal.<br><br>Blitz the grains of paradise in a high-powered blender or spice grinder until finely powdered, then set aside in a medium bowl.

This pickling liquid includes a touch of spice but is largely neutral, allowing the flavors of the pickled vegetables to emerge. I like the balance between the thyme and coriander on the softer herbal side with the habanero and ginger more biting, but play around as you like. Garlic goes well, ditto allspice, cloves, and bay leaf. Here’s your chance to go freeform and experiment with what aromatics you use in the pickling liquid and what you pickle. Among my favorite vegetables to pickle are onions, mushrooms, and pig’s feet—which aren’t a vegetable at all, of course, but are delicious.<br><br>Place all the ingredients into a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat.

His new book is more significant than the original list of principles: It is part memoir, part how-to guide. It is a deeply personal story, with Mr. Dalio wading into how he started his firm in 1975, internal conflicts inside the company, and strife early on in his career. The book is both instructive and surprisingly moving. . . . Underneath what may seem like a clinical, emotionless approach is something different and far more poignant: Mr. Dalio is preaching for individuals to have a sense of humility and introspection, an ability to open themselves to appreciate pointed criticism and use it to improve.”<br> </span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">—</span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">The New York Times</span><span><br><br>“If there was an ‘it’ book for businesses or careers in 2017, it was Ray Dalio’s </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Principles</span><span>. The book, weighing in at nearly 600 pages, begins with the author’s own story, including the rise of Bridgewater Associates, Dalio’s highly successful investment firm. Part memoir, part strategic plan, Dalio uses his own history to provide suggestions on attaining success while always stressing the power of individuality and personal goals. This isn’t just a book for the power elite. Dalio’s highly detailed game plan focuses on what he calls ‘radical’ truths and transparencies, and are applicable to the careers of powerful CEOs, ladder-climbing executives, longtime grunts, and fresh-faced rookies.”<br> </span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">—</span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\">Chicago Tribune</span><span><br><br>“Ray Dalio has provided me with invaluable guidance and insights that are now available to you in </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Principles</span><span>.”<br> </span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">—Bill Gates</span><span><br><br>“I absolutely loved this book.

I’m tired. I drift back to sleep.<br><br>A few minutes pass, then I hear it again.<br><br>“What’s two plus two?”<br><br>The soft, feminine voice lacks emotion and the pronunciation is identical to the previous time she said it. It’s a computer. A computer is hassling me. I’m even more irritated now.<br><br>“Lrmln,” I say. I’m surprised. I meant to say “Leave me alone”—a completely reasonable response in my opinion—­but I failed to speak.<br><br>“Incorrect,” says the computer. “What’s two plus two?”<br><br>Time for an experiment. I’ll try to say hello.<br><br>“Hlllch?” I say.<br><br>“Incorrect. What’s two plus two?”<br><br>What’s going on? I want to find out, but I don’t have much to work with. I can’t see. I can’t hear anything other than the computer. I can’t even feel. No, that’s not true. I feel something. I’m lying down. I’m on something soft. A bed.<br><br>I think my eyes are closed. That’s not so bad. All I have to do is open them. I try, but nothing happens.<br><br>Why can’t I open my eyes?<br><br>Open.<br><br>Aaaand . . . open!<br><br>Open, dang it!<br><br>Ooh! I felt a wiggle that time. My eyelids moved. I felt it.<br><br>Open!<br><br>My eyelids creep up and blinding light sears my retinas.<br><br>“Glunn!” I say. I keep my eyes open with sheer force of will. Everything is white with shades of pain.<br><br>“Eye movement detected,” my tormenter says. “What’s two plus two?”<br><br>The whiteness lessens. My eyes are adjusting. I start to see shapes, but nothing sensible yet. Let’s see . . . can I move my hands? No.<br><br>Feet? Also no.<br><br>But I can move my mouth, right? I’ve been saying stuff. Not stuff that makes sense, but it’s something.<br><br>“Fffr.”<br><br>“Incorrect. What’s two plus two?”<br><br>The shapes start to make sense. I’m in a bed. It’s kind of . . . oval-­shaped.<br><br>LED lights shine down on me. Cameras in the ceiling watch my every move. Creepy though that is, I’m much more concerned about the robot arms.<br><br>The two brushed-­steel armatures hang from the ceiling. Each has an assortment of disturbingly penetration-­looking tools where hands should be. Can’t say I like the look of that.<br><br>“Ffff . . . oooh . . . rrrr,” I say. Will that do?<br><br>“Incorrect. What’s two plus two?”<br><br>Dang it. I summon all my willpower and inner strength. Also, I’m starting to panic a little. Good. I use that too.<br><br>“Fffoouurr,” I finally say.<br><br>“Correct.”<br><br>Thank God. I can talk. Sort of.<br><br>I breathe a sigh of relief. Wait—­I just controlled my breathing. I take another breath. On purpose. My mouth is sore. My throat is sore. But it’s my soreness. I have control.<br><br>I’m wearing a breathing mask. It’s tight to my face and connected to a hose that goes behind my head.<br><br>Can I get up?<br><br>No. But I can move my head a little. I look down at my body. I’m naked and connected to more tubes than I can count. There’s one in each arm, one in each leg, one in my “gentlemen’s equipment,” and two that disappear under my thigh. I’m guessing one of them is up where the sun doesn’t shine.<br><br>That can’t be good.<br><br>Also, I’m covered with electrodes. The sensor-­type stickers like for an EKG, but they’re all over the place. Well, at least they’re only on my skin instead of jammed into me.<br><br>“Wh—­” I wheeze. I try again. “Where . . . am . . . I?”<br><br>“What’s the cube root of eight?” the computer asks.<br><br>“Where am I?” I say again. This time it’s easier.<br><br>“Incorrect. What’s the cube root of eight?”<br><br>I take a deep breath and speak slowly. “Two times e to the two-­i-­pi over three.”<br><br>“Incorrect. What’s the cube root of eight?”<br><br>But I wasn’t incorrect. I just wanted to see how smart the computer was. Answer: not very.<br><br>“Two,” I say.<br><br>“Correct.”<br><br>I listen for follow-­up questions, but the computer seems satisfied.<br><br>I’m tired. I drift off to sleep again.<br><br>I wake up. How long was I out? It must have been a while because I feel rested. I open my eyes without any effort. That’s progress.<br><br>I try to move my fingers. They wiggle as instructed. All right. Now we’re getting somewhere.<br><br>“Hand movement detected,” says the computer. “Remain still.”<br><br>“What? Why—­”<br><br>The robot arms come for me. They move fast. Before I know it, they’ve removed most of the tubes from my body. I didn’t feel a thing. Though my skin is kind of numb anyway.<br><br>Only three tubes remain: an IV in my arm, a tube up my butt, and a catheter. Those latter two are kind of the signature items I wanted removed, but okay.<br><br>I raise my right arm and let it fall back to the bed. I do the same for my left. They feel heavy as heck. I repeat the process a few times. My arms are muscular. That doesn’t make sense. I assume I’ve had some massive medical problem and been in this bed for a while. Otherwise, why would they have me hooked up to all the stuff? Shouldn’t there be muscle atrophy?<br><br>And shouldn’t there be doctors? Or maybe the sounds of a hospital? And what’s with this bed? It’s not a rectangle, it’s an oval and I think it’s mounted to the wall instead of the floor.<br><br>“Take . . .” I trail off. Still kind of tired. “Take the tubes out. . . .”<br><br>The computer doesn’t respond.<br><br>I do a few more arm lifts. I wiggle my toes. I’m definitely getting better.<br><br>I tilt my ankles back and forth. They’re working. I raise my knees up. My legs are well toned too. Not bodybuilder thick, but still too healthy for someone on the verge of death. I’m not sure how thick they should be, though.<br><br>I press my palms to the bed and push. My torso rises. I’m actually getting up! It takes all my strength but I soldier on. The bed rocks gently as I move. It’s not a normal bed, that’s for sure. As I raise my head higher up, I see the head and foot of the elliptical bed are attached to strong-­looking wall mounts. It’s kind of a rigid hammock. Weird.<br><br>Soon, I’m sitting on my butt tube. Not the most comfortable sensation, but when is a tube up your butt ever comfortable?<br><br>I have a better view of things now. This is no ordinary hospital room. The walls look plastic and the whole room is round. Stark-­white light comes from ceiling-­mounted LED lights.<br><br>There are two more hammock-­like beds mounted to the walls, each with their own patient. We are arranged in a triangle and the roof-­mounted Arms of Harassment are in the center of the ceiling. I guess they take care of all three of us. I can’t see much of my compatriots—­they’ve sunken into their bedding like I had.<br><br>There’s no door. Just a ladder on the wall leading to . . . a hatch? It’s round and has a wheel-­handle in the center. Yeah, it’s got to be some kind of hatch. Like on a submarine. Maybe the three of us have a contagious disease? Maybe this is an airtight quarantine room? There are small vents here and there on the wall and I feel a little airflow. It could be a controlled environment.<br><br>I slide one leg off over the edge of my bed, which makes it wobble. The robot arms rush ­toward me. I flinch, but they stop short and hover nearby. I think they’re ready to grab me if I fall.<br><br>“Full-­body motion detected,” the computer says. “What’s your name?”<br><br>“Pfft, seriously?” I ask.<br><br>“Incorrect. Attempt number two: What’s your name?”<br><br>I open my mouth to answer.<br><br>“Uh . . .”<br><br>“Incorrect. Attempt number three: What’s your name?”<br><br>Only now does it occur to me: I don’t know who I am. I don’t know what I do. I don’t remember anything at all.<br><br>“Um,” I say.<br><br>“Incorrect.”<br><br>A wave of fatigue grips me. It’s kind of pleasant, actually. The computer must have sedated me through the IV line.<br><br>“. . . waaaait . . .” I mumble.<br><br>The robot arms lay me gently back down to the bed.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	17.32,	28.99,	0,	'Ballantine Books; 1st edition (May 4, 2021)',	'English',	'496 pages',	'1.7 pounds',	'6.35 x 1.52 x 9.7 inches',	'9217af8cd23a457d9978f25b92ced0173e47a4c3.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat <br></span><span>Growing up, I thought salt belonged in a shaker at the table, and nowhere else. I never added it to food, or saw Maman add it to food. When my aunt Ziba, who had a well-documented taste for salt, sprinkled it onto her saffron rice at the table each night, my brothers and I giggled. We thought it was the strangest, funniest thing in the world. “What on earth,” I wondered, “can salt do for food?”<br> <br>I associated salt with the beach, where I spent my childhood seasoned with it. There were the endless hours in the Pacific, swallowing mouthful after mouthful of ocean water when I misjudged the waves. Tidepooling at twilight, my friends and I often fell victim to the saltwater spray while we poked at anemones. And my brothers, chasing me on the sand with giant kelp, would tickle and taunt me with its salty, otherworldly tassels whenever they caught up to me.<br> <br>Maman always kept our swimsuits in the back of our blue Volvo station wagon, because the beach was always where we wanted to be. She was deft with the umbrella and blankets, setting them up while she shooed the three of us into the sea.<br> <br>We’d stay in the water until we were starving, scanning the beach for the sun-faded coral-and-white umbrella, the only landmark that would lead us back to Maman. Wiping saltwater from our eyes, we beelined to her.<br> <br>Somehow, Maman always knew exactly what would taste best when we emerged: Persian cucumbers topped with sheep’s milk feta cheese rolled together in lavash bread. We chased the sandwiches with handfuls of ice-cold grapes or wedges of watermelon to quench our thirst.<br> <br>That snack, eaten while my curls dripped with seawater and salt crust formed on my skin, always tasted so good. Without a doubt, the pleasures of the beach added to the magic of the experience, but it wasn’t until many years later, working at Chez Panisse, that I understood why those bites had been so perfect from a culinary point of view.<br> <br>While bussing tables during the first year I worked at Chez Panisse, the closest I usually got to the food was at tasters, when the cooks made each dish for the chef to critique before service. With a menu that changed daily, the chef needed tasters to ensure that his or her vision was realized. Everything had to be just right. The cooks would tinker and adjust until satisfied; then they’d hand over the dishes to the floor staff to taste. On the tiny back porch, a dozen of us would hover over the plates, passing them around until we’d all had a bite of everything. It was there that I first tasted crisp deep-fried quail, tender salmon grilled in a fig leaf, and buttermilk panna cotta with fragrant wild strawberries. Often, the powerful flavors would haunt me throughout my shift.<br> <br></span><span>Once I developed culinary aspirations, Chris Lee, the chef who’d eventually take me under his wing, suggested that I pay less attention to what was happening on the porch during tasters, and more to what was happening in the kitchen. The language the chefs used, how they knew when something was right—these were clues about how to become a better cook. Most often, when a dish fell flat, the answer lay in adjusting the salt. Sometimes it was in the form of salt crystals, but other times it meant a grating of cheese, some pounded anchovies, a few olives, or a sprinkling of capers. I began to see that there is no better guide in the kitchen than thoughtful tasting, and that nothing is more important to taste thoughtfully for than salt.<br> <br>One day the following year, as a young cook in the prep kitchen, I was tasked with cooking polenta. I’d tasted polenta only once before coming to Chez Panisse, and I wasn’t a fan. Precooked and wrapped in plastic like a roll of cookie dough, it was flavorless. But I’d promised myself that I would try everything at the restaurant at least once, and when I tasted polenta for the second time, I couldn’t believe that something so creamy and complex could share a name with that flavorless tube of astronaut food. Milled from an heirloom variety of corn, each bite of the polenta at Chez Panisse tasted of sweetness and earth. I couldn’t wait to cook some myself.<br> <br>Once the chef, Cal Peternell, talked me through the steps of making the polenta, I began cooking. Consumed by the fear of scorching and ruining the entire humongous pot—a mistake I had seen other cooks make—I stirred maniacally.<br> <br>After an hour and a half, I’d added in butter and Parmesan, just as Cal had instructed me. I brought him a spoonful of the creamy porridge to taste. At six foot four, Cal is a gentle giant with sandy-blond hair and the driest of wits. I looked expectantly up at him with equal parts respect and terror. He said, in his signature deadpan, “It needs more salt.” Dutifully, I returned to the pot and sprinkled in a few grains of salt, treating them with the preciousness I might afford, say, gold leaf. I thought it tasted pretty good, so I returned to Cal with a spoonful of my newly adjusted polenta.<br> <br>Again, a moment’s consideration was all he needed to know the seasoning was off. But now—to save himself the trouble and time, I imagine—he marched me back to the pot and added not one but three enormous palmfuls of kosher salt.<br> <br>The perfectionist in me was horrified. I had wanted so badly to do that polenta justice! The degree to which I’d been off was exponential. Three palmfuls!<br> <br>Cal grabbed spoons and together we tasted. Some indescribable transformation had occurred. The corn was somehow sweeter, the butter richer. All of the flavors were more </span><span>pronounced. I’d been certain Cal had ruined the pot and turned my polenta into a salt lick, but no matter how I tried, the word salty did not apply to what I tasted. All I felt was a satisfying zing! with each mouthful.<br> <br>It was as if I’d been struck by lightning. It’d never occurred to me that salt was anything more than pepper’s sidekick. But now, having experienced the transformative power of salt for myself, I wanted to learn how to get that zing! every time I cooked. I thought about all of the foods I’d loved to eat growing up—and that bite of seaside cucumber and feta, in particular. I realized then why it had tasted so good.

The blue paint on our two-story house was sometimes chipped; the fence, or the rail by the stairs, or the front door might occasionally fall into disrepair, but that flag always flew pristine. Our corner lot, which had been redlined by the federal government, was along the river that divided the Black side from the white side of our Iowa town. At the edge of our lawn, high on an aluminum pole, soared the flag, which my dad would replace with a new one as soon as it showed the slightest tatter.<br><br>My dad was born into a family of sharecroppers on a white plantation in Greenwood, Mississippi, where Black people bent over cotton from can’t-see-in-the-morning to can’t-see-at-night, just as their enslaved ancestors had done not long before. The Mississippi of my dad’s youth was an apartheid state that subjugated its Black residents—almost half of the population—through breathtaking acts of violence. White residents in Mississippi lynched more Black people than those in any other state in the country, and the white people in my dad’s home county lynched more Black residents than those in any other county in Mississippi, for such “crimes” as entering a room occupied by white women, bumping into a white girl, or trying to start a sharecroppers union. My dad’s mother, like all the Black people in Greenwood, could not vote, use the public library, or find work other than toiling in the cotton fields or toiling in white people’s houses. In the 1940s, she packed up her few belongings and her three small children and joined the flood of Black Southerners fleeing to the North. She got off the Illinois Central Railroad in Waterloo, Iowa, only to have her hopes of the mythical Promised Land shattered when she learned that Jim Crow did not end at the Mason-Dixon Line.<br><br>Grandmama, as we called her, found a Victorian house in a segregated Black neighborhood on the city’s east side and then found the work that was considered Black women’s work no matter where Black women lived: cleaning white people’s homes. Dad, too, struggled to find promise in this land. In 1962, at age seventeen, he signed up for the army. Like many young men, he joined in hopes of escaping poverty. But he went into the military for another reason as well, a reason common to Black men: Dad hoped that if he served his country, his country might finally treat him as an American.<br><br>The army did not end up being his way out. He was passed over for opportunities, his ambition stunted. He would be discharged under murky circumstances and then labor in a series of service jobs for the rest of his life. Like all the Black men and women in my family, he believed in hard work, but like all the Black men and women in my family, no matter how hard he worked, he never got ahead.<br><br>So when I was young, that flag outside our home never made sense to me. How could this Black man, having seen firsthand the way his country abused Black Americans, the way it refused to treat us as full citizens, proudly fly its banner? My father had endured segregation in housing and school, discrimination in employment, and harassment by the police. He was one of the smartest people I knew, and yet by the time I was a work-study student in college, I was earning more an hour than he did. I didn’t understand his patriotism. It deeply embarrassed me.<br><br>I had been taught, in school, through cultural osmosis, that the flag wasn’t really ours, that our history as a people began with enslavement, and that we had contributed little to this great nation. It seemed that the closest thing Black Americans could have to cultural pride was to be found in our vague connection to Africa, a place we had never been. That my dad felt so much honor in being an American struck me as a marker of his degradation, of his acceptance of our subordination.<br><br>Like most young people, I thought I understood so much, when in fact I understood so little. My father knew exactly what he was doing when he raised that flag. He knew that our people’s contributions to building the richest and most powerful nation in the world were indelible, that the United States simply would not exist without us.<br><br>In August 1619, just twelve years after the English settled Jamestown, Virginia, one year before the Puritans landed at Plymouth, and some 157 years before English colonists here decided they wanted to form their own country, the Jamestown colonists bought twenty to thirty enslaved Africans from English pirates. The pirates had stolen them from a Portuguese slave ship whose crew had forcibly taken them from what is now the country of Angola. Those men and women who came ashore on that August day mark the beginning of slavery in the thirteen colonies that would become the United States of America. They were among the more than 12.5 million Africans who would be kidnapped from their homes and brought in chains across the Atlantic Ocean in the largest forced migration in human history until the Second World War. Almost two million did not survive the grueling journey, known as the Middle Passage.<br><br>Before the abolition of the international slave trade, more than four hundred thousand of those 12 million enslaved Africans transported to the Americas would be sold into this land. Those individuals and their descendants transformed the North American colonies into some of the most successful in the British Empire. Through backbreaking labor, they cleared territory across the Southeast. They taught the colonists to grow rice and to inoculate themselves against smallpox. After the American Revolution, they grew and picked the cotton that, at the height of slavery, became the nation’s most valuable export, accounting for half of American goods sold abroad and more than two-thirds of the world’s supply. They helped build the forced labor camps, otherwise known as plantations, of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, sprawling properties that today attract tens of thousands of visitors from across the globe captivated by the history of the world’s greatest democracy. They laid the foundations of the White House and the Capitol, even cast with their unfree hands the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol dome. They lugged the heavy wooden tracks of the railroads that crisscrossed the South and carried the cotton picked by enslaved laborers to textile mills in the North, fueling this country’s Industrial Revolution. They built vast fortunes for white people in both the North and the South—at one time, the second-richest man in the nation was a Rhode Island “slave trader.” Profits from Black people’s stolen labor helped the young nation pay off its war debts and financed some of our most prestigious universities. The relentless buying, selling, insuring, and financing of their bodies and the products of their forced labor would help make Wall Street a thriving banking, insurance, and trading sector, and New York City a financial capital of the world.<br><br>But it would be historically inaccurate to reduce the contributions of Black people to the vast material wealth created by our bondage. Black Americans have also been, and continue to be, foundational to the idea of American freedom. More than any other group in this country’s history, we have served, generation after generation, in an overlooked but vital role: it is we who have been the perfecters of this democracy.<br><br>The United States is a nation founded on both an ideal and a lie. Our Declaration of Independence, approved on July 4, 1776, proclaims that “all men are created equal” and “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.” But the white men who drafted those words did not believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of Black people in their midst. A right to “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” did not include fully one-fifth of the new country. Yet despite being violently denied the freedom and justice promised to all, Black Americans believed fervently in the American creed. Through centuries of Black resistance and protest, we have helped the country live up to its founding ideals. And not only for ourselves—Black rights struggles paved the way for every other rights struggle, including women’s and gay rights, immigrant and disability rights.<br><br>Without the idealistic, strenuous, and patriotic efforts of Black Americans, our democracy today would look very different; in fact, our country might not be a democracy at all.<br><br>One of the very first to die in the American Revolution was a Black and Indigenous man named Crispus Attucks who himself was not free. In 1770, Attucks lived as a fugitive from slavery, yet he became a martyr for liberty in a land where his own people would remain enslaved for almost another century. In every war this nation has waged since that first one, Black Americans have fought—today we are the most likely of all racial groups to serve in the United States military.<br><br>My father, one of those many Black Americans who answered the call, knew what it would take me years to understand: that the year 1619 is as important to the American story as 1776. That Black Americans, as much as those men cast in alabaster in the nation’s capital, are this nation’s true founding fathers. And that no people has a greater claim to that flag than we do.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	22.8,	38,	0,	'One World (November 16, 2021)',	'English',	'624 pages',	'2 pounds',	'6.4 x 1.49 x 9.43 inches',	'3d9fcacf5bde262e3da2a2373bc25d25262c0766.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

Each recipe includes short testimonials from some of the 750-plus kids who were part of the test group, making the book fun and interactive. The cookbook also features informational sections for new chefs, such as \"Getting Started in the Kitchen\" and \"Conversions and Equivalents.\" Taking a stance on nutrition, the work provides a section on \"Healthy Eating 101\" in the back matter, which includes information dedicated to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s MyPlate system of five food groups. The design of the book is busy and blocky, reminiscent of Pinterest or Instagram, with informational asides and related tidbits with snappy headings. The organization follows a similar tact, including general information-such as how to choose the right kid-friendly knife-among the recipes, rather than in the front matter of the book that is dedicated to \"Getting Started in the Kitchen.\" The pictures are small (there are no full-page spreads) and few step-by-step photos are included. Younger cooks and emergent readers may feel overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of information contained on a page, as the format sometimes fights the procedural and chronological nature of a recipe.

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">Introduction</span><span><br><br>I really tried to not be a cook. I mean, this little gay Persian boy imagined he was going to be the next Al Pacino. Then, I thought I might be an anthropology professor. After I ghosted that idea, I put in a couple of years in the fashion world but grew tired of the lack of food in that industry.<br><br> Just because you love something deeply, I thought, doesn’t mean you should make it your career. I think I feared that if I worked in kitchens, the job would suck the joy out of what was always more than a hobby—more like an obsession—to me. <br><br>Thing is, I don’t remember a time when I was not obsessed with food. I remember going on a family trip to Paris when my sister and I were kids and we were each allowed to get one souvenir. She wanted a pair of leathery strappy black stilettos. I wanted a fancy restaurant meal with as many courses as I could get (I got five).<br><br>Eventually, I took one restaurant job that led to another. And over the years (15 now!), after putting in the time in and out of restaurants and editorial test kitchens, traveling around the world to (mostly) eat, and still constantly thinking about what I would cook for dinner, I’ve learned a lot that I’m excited to finally share in this book. I learned how to prep two buckets worth of onions lightning fast and to break down a whole lamb. I learned how pork shoulder, generally a tough cut of meat, will fall apart at the touch of a fork after gentle braising over low heat. I learned how to buy spices whole and toast them to get their fullest flavor. I picked up the habit of constantly tasting while I cook. I became an encyclopedia of ingredients. I may have even become slightly better than my mom (!) at making Persian rice. I now know that if the chicory I’m buying is small, tender, and barely bitter, it would be perfect in a salad. But if it’s large and unruly, and so bitter it would make your mouth pucker, it should be browned in butter and gently cooked with a bit of stock. And I know there’s still so much more for me to learn. <br><br>All of these experiences have helped me discover my own cooking style—a style that took time to develop. I crave simple, delicious cooking rather than dishes that are overly complicated. Generally, I keep a pretty tight pantry but I do admit to having a large collection of spices. I am picky about rice because it can have major mood swings compared with how pasta behaves. I want my food to look beautiful and to impress—not just your friends but yourself!<br><br> I know that my food may be a touch too lemony for some. And that I use what has been called a ridiculous amount of herbs. I prefer vegetables to meat. (But I still love meat!) I have an aversion to many kitchen tools and would rather do most tasks with my hands so I can slow down and relax a bit. I know that if I can’t efficiently make a recipe in my tiny home kitchen, then I won’t develop it. <br><br>The recipes that follow were formed by the lessons I’ve learned over time. Some are deeply personal; these are recipes inspired by the Persian food I grew up with, the restaurants I’ve worked at, or dishes I’ve tasted while traveling. I want you to make and love the recipes, and REALLY use this book until it is beautifully turmeric-stained all over. Maybe you’re here to find some dinner inspiration. I got you. But these recipes will also teach you a few tricks, answer questions you may have about a technique, or lead you to discover that maybe you’re not that into parsley (But are you sure??)<br><br>There are a few cooking rules I live by and think you should too:<br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 1: COOK THE UNFAMILIAR </span><span><br><br>If you see an ingredient you’ve never seen before, whether a sheep’s milk cheese, an uncommon citrus, or an olive you’ve never tasted, buy it if it’s in your budget! So much of the joy of cooking is exploring and learning about new ingredients. Don’t ever get too comfortable. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 2: KEEP IT ORGANIZED </span><span><br><br>Look, I wouldn’t give myself a 10 in cleanliness but my score is pretty good. I’m not telling you to do dishes in between cooking, but rather to keep things organized and tidy so you don’t get overwhelmed and forget your next move. I like organized chaos. I find it facilitates the best kind of cooking. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 3: LOSE THE GADGETS </span><span><br><br>Certain tools are essential to becoming a great cook—a sharp knife, a well-seasoned pan, a durable cutting board. I am wary of tools for specific tasks and technology that take the joy out of cooking. You will not find a garlic press in my kitchen and never will I own an Instant Pot. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 4: TRY AGAIN </span><span><br><br>If you screw up a recipe and you’re traumatized from undercooked chicken (if you do, just see page 232 and make chicken broth) and never want to face it again, well, don’t give up so fast. Make it again and learn from what went wrong. Repetition makes you a better, more evolved cook.<br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 5: WHEN IN DOUBT, REACH FOR SALT OR ACID </span><span><br><br>I’ve heard from so many home cooks that their food doesn’t taste right. Most of the time it’s because the dish is missing salt—the flavors are hiding there, waiting to come out. Or it happens because there’s so much going on in the dish that the flavors are all jumbled up; a hit of acid (citrus or vinegar) will clear things up. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 6: DON’T OVERTHINK </span><span><br><br>This rule could probably be useful in life to most people. I try to be effortless in my cooking. If a piece of fruit is perfectly ripe and doesn’t need much else but some salt and a squeeze of lemon, I go with it. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 7: FLAKY SALT EQUALS MAGIC </span><span><br><br>Flaky salt just makes everything look a touch more fancy. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 8: KEEP IT SHARP </span><span><br><br>I am not one to advocate for spending a small fortune on a chef’s knife. However, I do think it’s essential to keep whatever brand of chef knife you have sharp. Honing it? Sure, a good quick fix. Using a whetstone? You get a gold star. Sending it out to a professional? Do whatever you gotta do. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 9: WATER WORKS </span><span><br><br>It can fix a broken aioli. Along with a handful of aromatics, it can be the base for soup or stew instead of stock. A splash will loosen a thick sauce. It keeps you and your plants alive! Love it, drink it . . . and cook with it. <br><br></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\">RULE NO. 10: ALWAYS BE TASTING </span><span><br><br>I taste a dish a minimum of three times before it gets plated. I’ll snack on some of the raw ingredients while I’m doing the prep, again halfway through when the dish is coming together, and then once more when it’s almost finished. I might adjust the salt and fat each time, so whatever I’m cooking tastes right before I serve. Nevertheless, some people are still going to ask you to pass the salt and pepper. Live with it! <br><br>My goal is not just for you to love the recipes in this book—I do want that—but to take these nuggets of info and integrate them into your daily cooking routine. I want you to be excited by a spice mix and feel empowered to use it on another ingredient that I might have not suggested. I also want you to apply a technique you learned—whether from me or elsewhere—to other recipes you make. Air-fry my meatballs?! I won’t tell. <br><br>If you come to understand the recipes and techniques in this book, you’ll recognize the flavors and textures you’re drawn to and be able to determine what tastes good to you. And between all that cooking and eating, you’ll become the cook you want to be.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	31.5,	35,	0,	'Lorena Jones Books (May 24, 2022)',	'English',	'336 pages',	'3.2 pounds',	'8.2 x 1.04 x 10.79 inches',	'a9ecc113623eafac45f368d2bd24c72827d25822.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

If You Answer the Door for Strangers… </span><h2><span>If You Answer the Door for Strangers… <br>You see it all the time on television. There’s a knock at the front door. And, on the other side, someone is waiting to tell you the news that changes everything. On television, it’s usually a police chaplain or a firefighter, maybe a uniformed officer from the armed forces. But when I open the door—when I learn that everything is about to change for me—the messenger isn’t a cop or a federal investigator in starched pants. It’s a twelve-year-old girl, in a soccer uniform. Shin guards and all.<br> <br>“Mrs. Michaels?” she says.<br> <br>I hesitate before answering—the way I often do when someone asks me if that is who I am. I am and I’m not. I haven’t changed my name. I was Hannah Hall for the thirty-eight years before I met Owen, and I didn’t see a reason to become someone else after. But Owen and I have been married for a little over a year. And, in that time, I’ve learned not to correct people either way. Because what they really want to know is whether I’m Owen’s wife.<br> <br>It’s certainly what the twelve-year-old wants to know, which leads me to explain how I can be so certain that she is twelve, having spent most of my life seeing people in two broad categories: child and adult. This change is a result of the last year and a half, a result of my husband’s daughter, Bailey, being the stunningly disinviting age of sixteen. It’s a result of my mistake, upon first meeting the guarded Bailey, of telling her that she looked younger than she was. It was the worst thing I could have done.<br> <br>Maybe it was the second worst. The worst thing was probably my attempt to make it better by cracking a joke about how I wished someone would age me down. Bailey has barely stomached me since, despite the fact that I now know better than to try to crack a joke of any kind with a sixteen-year-old. Or, really, to try and talk too much at all.<br> <br>But back to my twelve-year-old friend standing in the doorway, shifting from dirty cleat to dirty cleat.<br> <br>“Mr. Michaels wanted me to give you this,” she says.<br> <br>Then she thrusts out her hand, a folded piece of yellow legal paper inside her palm. </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">HANNAH</span><span> is written on the front in Owen’s writing.<br> <br>I take the folded note, hold her eyes. “I’m sorry,” I say. “I’m missing something. Are you a friend of Bailey’s?”<br> <br>“Who’s Bailey?”<br> <br>I didn’t expect the answer to be yes. There is an ocean between twelve and sixteen. But I can’t piece this together. Why hasn’t Owen just called me? Why is he involving this girl? My first guess would be that something has happened to Bailey, and Owen couldn’t break away. But Bailey is at home, avoiding me as she usually does, her blasting music (today’s selection: </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Beautiful: The Carole King Musical</span><span>) pulsing all the way down the stairs, its own looping reminder that I’m not welcome in her room.<br> <br>“I’m sorry. I’m a little confused… where did you see him?”<br> <br>“He ran past me in the hall,” she says.<br> <br>For a minute I think she means our hall, the space right behind us. But that doesn’t make sense. We live in a floating home on the bay, a houseboat as they are commonly called, except here in Sausalito, where there’s a community of them. Four hundred of them. Here they are floating homes—all glass and views. Our sidewalk is a dock, our hallway is a living room.<br> <br>“So you saw Mr. Michaels at school?”<br> <br>“That’s what I just said.” She gives me a look, like </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">where else</span><span>? “Me and my friend Claire were on our way to practice. And he asked us to drop this off. I said I couldn’t come until after practice and he said, fine. He gave us your address.”<br> <br>She holds up a second piece of paper, like proof.<br> <br>“He also gave us twenty bucks,” she adds.<br> <br>The money she doesn’t hold up. Maybe she thinks I’ll take it back.<br> <br>“His phone was broken or something and he couldn’t reach you. I don’t know. He barely slowed down.”<br> <br>“So… he said his phone was broken?”<br> <br>“How else would I know?” she says.<br> <br>Then her phone rings—or I think it’s a phone until she picks it off her waist and it looks more like a high-tech beeper. Are beepers back?<br> <br>Carole King show tunes. High-tech beepers. Another reason Bailey probably doesn’t have patience for me. There’s a world of teen things I know absolutely nothing about.<br> <br>The girl taps away on her device, already putting Owen and her twenty-dollar mission behind her. I’m reluctant to let her go, still unsure about what is going on. Maybe this is some kind of weird joke. Maybe Owen thinks this is funny. I don’t think it’s funny. Not yet, anyway.<br> <br>“See you,” she says.<br> <br>She starts walking away, heading down the docks. I watch her get smaller and smaller, the sun down over the bay, a handful of early evening stars lighting her way.<br> <br>Then I step outside myself. I half expect Owen (my lovely and silly Owen) to jump out from the side of the dock, the rest of the soccer team giggling behind him, the lot of them letting me in on the prank I’m apparently not getting. But he isn’t there. No one is.<br> <br>So I close our front door. And I look down at the piece of yellow legal paper still folded in my hand. I haven’t opened it yet.<br> <br>It occurs to me, in the quiet, how much I don’t want to open it. I don’t want to know what the note says. Part of me still wants to hold on to this one last moment—the moment where you still get to believe this is a joke, an error, a big nothing; the moment before you know for sure that something has started that you can no longer stop.<br> <br>I unfold the paper.<br> <br>Owen’s note is short. One line, its own puzzle.<br> <br></span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Protect her.</span><span><br></span></h2>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	13.5,	27,	0,	'Simon & Schuster; First Edition (May 4, 2021)',	'English',	'320 pages',	'1.07 pounds',	'6 x 1 x 9 inches',	'488a59f5328582db9b7a7656dcde3c36160dfe14.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

Set in the 1950s, </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">The Lincoln Highway</span><span> is filled with nostalgia as well as the gentle naïveté and hijinks of those who are young, optimistic, and on a mission. The story follows four boys who set out to travel the country in search of a fresh start: Emmett and Billy want to find their mother who left them when they were young, and Duchess and Woolly are on the hunt for a stashed wad of cash. Sometimes their dreams are aligned but often they are not. In other words, adventure ensues: There’s train hopping and car stealing, and with that comes the inevitability of trouble sparked from both good and bad intentions. Each of these young men is chasing his dreams, but their pasts—whether violent or sad—are never far behind. A remarkable work of storytelling that is a 2021 favorite. </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">—Al Woodworth, Amazon Editor</span>  </div>         <h3><span>Review</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span class=\"a-text-bold\"><u>Praise for </u></span><span class=\"a-text-bold a-text-italic\"><u>The Lincoln Highway</u></span><span class=\"a-text-bold\"><u>:</u></span><span><br><br>“[A] mischievous, wise and wildly entertaining novel . . . Towles goes all in on the kind of episodic, exuberant narrative haywire found in myth or Homeric epic . . . Each [character], Towles implies, is the central protagonist of an ongoing adventure that is both unique and universal . . . remarkably buoyant . . . permeated with light, wit, youth . . .

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span>Emmett<br>  <br> June 12, 1954—The drive from Salina to Morgen was three hours, and for much of it, Emmett hadn’t said a word. For the first sixty miles or so, Warden Williams had made an effort at friendly conversation. He had told a few stories about his childhood back East and asked a few questions about Emmett’s on the farm. But this was the last they’d be together, and Emmett didn’t see much sense in going into all of that now. So when they crossed the border from Kansas into Nebraska and the warden turned on the radio, Emmett stared out the window at the prairie, keeping his thoughts to himself.<br><br> When they were five miles south of town, Emmett pointed through the windshield.<br><br> —You take that next right. It’ll be the white house about four miles down the road.<br><br> The warden slowed his car and took the turn. They drove past the McKusker place, then the Andersens’ with its matching pair of large red barns. A few minutes later they could see Emmett’s house standing beside a small grove of oak trees about thirty yards from the road. To Emmett, all the houses in this part of the country looked like they’d been dropped from the sky. The Watson house just looked like it’d had a rougher landing. The roof line sagged on either side of the chimney and the window frames were slanted just enough that half the windows wouldn’t quite open and the other half wouldn’t quite shut. In another moment, they’d be able to see how the paint had been shaken right off the clapboard. But when they got within a hundred feet of the driveway, the warden pulled to the side of the road.<br><br> —Emmett, he said, with his hands on the wheel, before we drive in there’s something I’d like to say.<br><br> That Warden Williams had something to say didn’t come as much of a surprise. When Emmett had first arrived at Salina, the warden was a Hoosier named Ackerly, who wasn’t inclined to put into words a piece of advice that could be delivered more efficiently with a stick. But Warden Williams was a modern man with a master’s degree and good intentions and a framed photograph of Franklin D. Roosevelt hanging behind his desk. He had notions that he’d gathered from books and experience, and he had plenty of words at his disposal to turn them into counsel.<br><br> —For some of the young men who come to Salina, he began, whatever series of events has brought them under our sphere of influence is just the beginning of a long journey through a life of trouble. They’re boys who were never given much sense of right or wrong as children and who see little reason for learning it now. Whatever values or ambitions we try to instill in them will, in all likelihood, be cast aside the moment they walk out from under our gaze. Sadly, for these boys it is only a matter of time before they find themselves in the correctional facility at Topeka, or worse.<br><br>The warden turned to Emmett.<br><br> —What I’m getting at, Emmett, is that you are not one of them. We haven’t known each other long, but from my time with you I can tell that that boy’s death weighs heavily on your conscience. No one imagines what happened that night reflects either the spirit of malice or an expression of your character. It was the ugly side of chance. But as a civilized society, we ask that even those who have had an unintended hand in the misfortune of others pay some retribution. Of course, the payment of the retribution is in part to satisfy those who’ve suffered the brunt of the misfortune—like this boy’s family. But we also require that it be paid for the benefit of the young man who was the agent of misfortune. So that by having the opportunity to pay his debt, he too can find some solace, some sense of atonement, and thus begin the process of renewal. Do you understand me, Emmett?<br><br> —I do, sir.<br><br>—I’m glad to hear it. I know you’ve got your brother to care for now and the immediate future may seem daunting; but you’re a bright young man and you’ve got your whole life ahead of you. Having paid your debt in full, I just hope you’ll make the most of your liberty.<br><br>—That’s what I intend to do, Warden.<br><br>And in that moment, Emmett meant it. Because he agreed with most of what the warden said. He knew in the strongest of terms that his whole life was ahead of him and he knew that he needed to care for his brother. He knew too that he had been an agent of misfortune rather than its author. But he didn’t agree that his debt had been paid in full. For no matter how much chance has played a role, when by your hands you have brought another man’s time on earth to its end, to prove to the Almighty that you are worthy of his mercy, that shouldn’t take any less than the rest of your life.<br><br>The warden put the car in gear and turned into the Watsons’. In the clearing by the front porch were two cars—a sedan and a pickup. The warden parked beside the pickup. When he and Emmett got out of the car, a tall man with a cowboy hat in his hand came out the front door and off the porch.<br><br>—Hey there, Emmett.<br><br> —Hey, Mr. Ransom.<br><br>The warden extended his hand to the rancher.<br><br>—I’m Warden Williams. It was nice of you to take the trouble to meet us.<br><br>—It was no trouble, Warden.<br><br>—I gather you’ve known Emmett a long time.<br><br>—Since the day he was born.<br>   <br> The warden put a hand on Emmett’s shoulder.<br><br>—Then I don’t need to explain to you what a fine young man he is. I was just telling him in the car that having paid his debt to society, he’s got his whole life ahead of him.<br><br>—He does at that, agreed Mr. Ransom. The three men stood without speaking.<br> The warden had lived in the Midwest for less than a year now, but he knew from standing at the foot of other farmhouse porches that at this point in a conversation you were likely to be invited inside and offered something cool to drink; and when you received the invitation, you should be ready to accept because it would be taken as rude if you were to decline, even if you did have a three-hour drive ahead of you. But neither Emmett nor Mr. Ransom made any indication of asking the warden in.<br><br>—Well, he said after a moment, I guess I should be heading back. Emmett and Mr. Ransom offered a final thanks to the warden, shook his hand, then watched as he climbed in his car and drove away.<br><br>The warden was a quarter mile down the road when Emmett nodded toward the sedan.<br><br>—Mr. Obermeyer’s?<br><br>—He’s waiting in the kitchen.<br><br>—And Billy?<br><br>—I told Sally to bring him over a little later, so you and Tom can get your business done.<br> Emmett nodded.<br><br>—You ready to go in? asked Mr. Ransom.<br><br>—The sooner the better, said Emmett.<br>  <br> They found Tom Obermeyer seated at the small kitchen table. He was wearing a white shirt with short sleeves and a tie. If he was also wearing a suit coat, he must have left it in his car because it wasn’t hanging on the back of the chair. <br>  <br> When Emmett and Mr. Ransom came through the door, they seemed to catch the banker off his guard, because he abruptly scraped back the chair, stood up, and stuck out his hand all in a single motion.<br><br>—Well, hey now, Emmett. It’s good to see you. Emmett shook the banker’s hand without a reply.<br> Taking a look around, Emmett noted that the floor was swept, the counter clear, the sink empty, the cabinets closed. The kitchen looked cleaner than at any point in Emmett’s memory.<br><br>—Here, Mr. Obermeyer said, gesturing to the table. Why don’t we all sit down.<br><br>Emmett took the chair opposite the banker. Mr. Ransom remained standing, leaning his shoulder against the doorframe. On the table was a brown folder thick with papers. It was sitting just out of the banker’s reach, as if it had been left there by somebody else. Mr. Obermeyer cleared his throat.<br><br>—First of all, Emmett, let me say how sorry I am about your father. He was a fine man and too young to be taken by illness.<br><br>—Thank you.<br><br>—I gather when you came for the funeral that Walter Eberstadt had a chance to sit down with you and discuss your father’s estate.<br><br>—He did, said Emmett.<br> The banker nodded with a look of sympathetic understanding.<br><br>—Then I suspect Walter explained that three years ago your father took out a new loan on top of the old mortgage. At the time, he said it was to upgrade his equipment. In actuality, I suspect a good portion of that loan went to pay some older debts since the only new piece of farm equipment we could find on the property was the John Deere in the barn. Though I suppose that’s neither here nor there.<br><br>Emmett and Mr. Ransom seemed to agree that this was neither here nor there because neither made any effort to respond. The banker cleared his throat again.<br><br>—The point I’m getting to is that in the last few years the harvest wasn’t what your father had hoped; and this year, what with your father’s passing, there isn’t going to be a harvest at all. So we had no choice but to call in the loan. It’s an unpleasant bit of business, I know, Emmett, but I want you to understand that it was not an easy decision for the bank to make.<br><br>—I should think it would be a pretty easy decision for you to make by now, said Mr. Ransom, given how much practice you get at making it.<br><br>The banker looked to the rancher.<br><br>—Now, Ed, you know that’s not fair. No bank makes a loan in hopes of foreclosing.<br><br>The banker turned back to Emmett.<br><br>—The nature of a loan is that it requires the repayment of interest and principal on a timely basis. Even so, when a client in good standing falls behind, we do what we can to make concessions. To extend terms and defer collections. Your father is a perfect example. When he began falling behind, we gave him some extra time. And when he got sick, we gave him some more. But sometimes a man’s bad luck becomes too great to surmount, no matter how much time you give him.<br><br>The banker reached out his arm to lay a hand on the brown folder, finally claiming it as his own.<br><br>—We could have cleared out the property and put it up for sale a month ago, Emmett. It was well within our rights to do so. But we didn’t. We waited so that you could complete your term at Salina and come home to sleep in your own bed. We wanted you to have a chance to go through the house with your brother in an unhurried fashion, to organize your personal effects. Hell, we even had the power company leave on the gas and electricity at our own expense.<br><br>—That was right kind of you, said Emmett. Mr. Ransom grunted.<br><br>—But now that you are home, continued the banker, it’s probably best for everyone involved if we see this process through to its conclusion. As the executor of your father’s estate, we’ll need you to sign a few papers. And within a few weeks, I’m sorry to say, we’ll need you to make arrangements for you and your brother to move out.<br><br>—If you’ve got something that needs signing, let’s sign it.<br><br>Mr. Obermeyer took a few documents from the folder. He turned them around so that they were facing Emmett and peeled back pages, explaining the purpose of individual sections and subsections, translating the terminology, pointing to where the documents should be signed and where initialed.<br><br>—You got a pen?<br><br>Mr. Obermeyer handed Emmett his pen. Emmett signed and initialed the papers without consideration, then slid them back across the table.<br><br>—That it?<br><br>—There is one other thing, said the banker, after returning the documents safely to their folder. The car in the barn. When we did the routine inventory of the house, we couldn’t find the registration or the keys.<br><br>—What do you need them for?<br><br>—The second loan your father took out wasn’t for specific pieces of agricultural machinery. It was against any new piece of capital equipment purchased for the farm, and I’m afraid that extends to personal vehicles.<br><br>—Not to that car it doesn’t.<br><br>—Now, Emmett . . .<br><br>—It doesn’t because that piece of capital equipment isn’t my father’s. It’s mine.<br><br>Mr. Obermeyer looked to Emmett with a mixture of skepticism and sympathy—two emotions that in Emmett’s view had no business being on the same face at the same time. Emmett took his wallet from his pocket, withdrew the registration, and put it on the table.<br> The banker picked it up and reviewed it.<br>   <br> —I see that the car is in your name, Emmett, but I’m afraid that if it was purchased by your father on your behalf . . .<br><br>—It was not.<br><br>The banker looked to Mr. Ransom for support. Finding none, he turned back to Emmett.<br><br>—For two summers, said Emmett, I worked for Mr. Schulte to earn the money to buy that car. I framed houses. Shingled roofs. Repaired porches. As a matter of fact, I even helped install those new cabinets in your kitchen. If you don’t believe me, you’re welcome to go ask Mr. Schulte. But either way, you’re not touching that car.<br><br>Mr. Obermeyer frowned. But when Emmett held out his hand for the registration, the banker returned it without protest. And when he left with his folder, he wasn’t particularly surprised that neither Emmett nor Mr. Ransom bothered seeing him to the door.<br>  <br> When the banker was gone, Mr. Ransom went outside to wait for Sally and Billy, leaving Emmett to walk the house on his own.<br><br>Like the kitchen, Emmett found the front room tidier than usual— with the pillows propped in the corners of the couch, the magazines in a neat little stack on the coffee table, and the top of his father’s desk rolled down. Upstairs in Billy’s room, the bed was made, the collections of bottle caps and bird feathers were neatly arranged on their shelves, and one of the windows had been opened to let in some air. A window must have been opened on the other side of the hall too because there was enough of a draft to stir the fighter planes hanging over Billy’s bed: replicas of a Spitfire, a Warhawk, and a Thunderbolt.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	18,	30,	0,	'Viking; 1st Edition (October 5, 2021)',	'English',	'592 pages',	'1.9 pounds',	'6.34 x 1.71 x 9.29 inches',	'a365e619cca914f03444b12bbd8d004baaadcd66.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span>Part One<br><br>caged<br><br>sparks<br><br>Four years ago, married to the father of my three children, I fell in love with a woman.<br><br>Much later, I watched that woman drive away from my home to meet with my parents and share her plan to propose to me. She thought I didn’t know what was happening that Sunday morning, but I knew.<br><br>When I heard her car return, I settled into the couch, opened a book, and tried to slow my pulse. She walked through the door and directly toward me, bent down, kissed my forehead. She pushed my hair aside and took a deep breath of my neck, like she always does. Then she stood up and disappeared into the bedroom. I walked to the kitchen to pour some coffee for her, and when I turned around, she was right there in front of me, down on one knee, holding a ring. Her eyes were certain and pleading, wide and laser focused, sky blue, bottomless.<br><br>“I couldn’t wait,” she said. “I just could not wait another minute.”<br><br>Later, in bed, I laid my head on her chest while we talked about her morning. She’d told my parents, “I love your daughter and grandchildren like I’ve never loved before. I’ve spent my entire life searching and preparing myself for them. I promise you that I will love and protect them forever.” My mother’s lip quivered with fear and courage as she said, “Abby. I have not seen my daughter this alive since she was ten years old.”<br><br>Much else was said that morning, but that first response from my mother jumped out at me like a sentence in a novel begging to be underlined:<br><br>I have not seen my daughter this alive since she was ten years old.<br><br>My mother watched the spark in my eyes fade during my tenth year on Earth. Now, thirty years later, she was witnessing the return of that spark. In the past few months, my entire posture had changed. I looked regal to her. And a little scary.<br><br>After that day, I began to ask myself: Where did my spark go at ten? How had I lost myself?<br><br>I’ve done my research and learned this: Ten is when we learn how to be good girls and boys. Ten is when children begin to let go of who they are in order to become what the world expects them to be. Ten is when our formal taming begins.<br><br>Ten is when the world sat me down, told me to be quiet, and pointed toward my cages:<br><br>These are the feelings you may express.<br><br>This is the version of womanhood you will mimic.<br><br>This is the body you must strive for.<br><br>These are the things you will believe.<br><br>These are the people you may love.<br><br>Those are the people you will fear.<br><br>This is the kind of life you will want.<br><br>Make yourself fit. You’ll be uncomfortable at first, but don’t worry—eventually you’ll forget you’re caged. Soon this will just feel like: life.<br><br>I wanted to be a good girl, so I tried to control myself. I chose a personality, a body, a faith, and a sexuality so tiny I had to hold my breath to fit myself inside. Then I promptly became very sick.<br><br>When I became a good girl, I also became a bulimic. None of us can hold our breath all the time. Bulimia was where I exhaled. It was where I refused to comply, indulged my hunger, and expressed my fury. I became animalistic during my daily binges. Then I’d drape myself over the toilet and purge because a good girl must stay very small to fit inside her cages. She must leave no outward evidence of her hunger. Good girls aren’t hungry, furious, or wild. All of the things that make a woman human are a good girl’s dirty secret.<br><br>Back then, I suspected that my bulimia meant that I was crazy. In high school, did a stint in a mental hospital and my suspicion was confirmed.<br><br>I understand myself differently now.<br><br>I was just a caged girl made for wide-open skies.<br><br>I wasn’t crazy. I was a goddamn cheetah.<br><br>When I saw Abby, I remembered my wild. I wanted her, and it was the first time I wanted something beyond what I had been trained to want. I loved her, and it was the first time I loved someone beyond those I had been expected to love. Creating a life with her was the first original idea I’d ever had and the first decision I made as a free woman. After thirty years of contorting myself to fit inside someone else’s idea of love, I finally had a love that fit—custom made for me, by me. I’d finally asked myself what I wanted instead of what the world wanted from me. I felt alive. I’d tasted freedom, and I wanted more.<br><br>I looked hard at my faith, my friendships, my work, my sexuality, my entire life and asked: How much of this was my idea? Do I truly want any of this, or is this what I was conditioned to want? Which of my beliefs are of my own creation and which were programmed into me? How much of who I’ve become is inherent, and how much was just inherited? How much of the way I look and speak and behave is just how other people have trained me to look and speak and behave? How much of what I’ve spent my life chasing are just dirty pink bunnies? Who was I before I became who the world told me to be?<br><br>Over time, I walked away from my cages. I slowly built a new marriage, a new faith, a new worldview, a new purpose, a new family, and a new identity by design instead of default. From my imagination instead of my indoctrination. From my wild instead of from my training.<br><br>What follows are stories about how I got caged—and how I got free.<br><br>apples<br><br>I am ten years old, and I’m sitting in a small room in the back of Nativity Catholic Church with twenty other kids. I am at CCD, where my parents send me on Wednesday nights to learn about God. Our CCD teacher is my classmate’s mom. I do not remember her name, but I do remember that she keeps telling us that she is an accountant during the day. Her family needed service hours, so she volunteered to work in the gift shop. Instead, the church assigned her to room 423, fifth-grade CCD. So now—on Wednesdays between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m.—she teaches children about God.<br><br>She asks us to sit on the carpet in front of her chair, because she is going to explain to us how God made people. I hurry to get a spot in front. I am very curious about how and why I was made. I notice that our teacher does not have a Bible or any other books in her lap. She is going to speak from memory. I am impressed.<br><br>She begins.<br><br>“God made Adam and put him in a beautiful garden. Adam was God’s favorite creation, so He told Adam that his only jobs were to be happy, rule over the garden, and name the animals. Adam’s life was almost perfect. Except that he got lonely and stressed. He wanted some company and help naming the animals. So he told God that he wanted a companion and a helper. One night, God helped Adam give birth to Eve. From inside Adam’s body, a woman was born. That is why she is called woman. Because women came from the womb of man. Womb—man.”<br><br>I am so amazed that I forget to raise my hand.<br><br>“Wait. Adam gave birth to Eve? But don’t people come from women’s bodies? Shouldn’t boys be called woman? Shouldn’t all people be called woman?”<br><br>My teacher says, “Raise your hand, Glennon.”<br><br>I raise my hand. She motions for me to put it back down. The boy sitting to my left rolls his eyes at me.<br><br>Our teacher goes on.<br><br>“Adam and Eve were happy, and everything stayed perfect for a while.<br><br>“But then God said there was one tree they couldn’t eat from: the Tree of Knowledge. Even though it was the only thing in the entire garden that Eve wasn’t allowed to want, she wanted an apple from that tree anyway. So one day, she got hungry, picked the apple off the tree, and took a bite. Then she tricked Adam into taking a bite, too. As soon as Adam bit into the apple, Eve and Adam felt shame for the first time and tried to hide from God. But God sees everything, so God knew. God banished Adam and Eve from the beautiful garden. Then He cursed them and their future children, and for the first time, suffering existed on the earth. This is why we still suffer today, because Eve’s original sin is inside of all of us. That sin is wanting to know more than we are supposed to know, wanting more instead of being grateful for what we have, and doing what we want to do instead of what we should do.”<br><br>That was some careful accounting. I had no further questions.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	15,	28,	0,	'The Dial Press; Later Printing edition (March 10, 2020)',	'English',	'352 pages',	'1.05 pounds',	'5.9 x 1.32 x 8.46 inches',	'cb59c1e1cf73cbbdb3524e2f4c8b734bdd0f0832.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">One<br><br>March 13, 2020</span><span><br><br>When I was six years old, I painted a corner of the sky. My father was working as a conservator, one of a handful restoring the zodiac ceiling on the main hall of Grand Central Terminal—an aqua sky strung with shimmering constellations. It was late, way past my bedtime, but my father took me to work because my mother—as usual—was not home.<br><br>He helped me carefully climb the scaffolding, where I watched him working on a cleaned patch of the turquoise paint. I looked at the stars representing the smear of the Milky Way, the golden wings of Pegasus, Orion’s raised club, the twisted fish of Pisces. The original mural had been painted in 1913, my father told me. Roof leaks damaged the plaster, and in 1944, it had been replicated on panels that were attached to the arched ceiling. The original plan had been to remove the boards for restoration, but they contained asbestos, and so the conservators left them in place, and went to work with cotton swabs and cleaning solution, erasing decades of pollutants.<br><br>They uncovered history. Signatures and inside jokes and notes left behind by the original artists were revealed, tucked in among the constellations. There were dates commemorating weddings, and the end of World War II. There were names of soldiers. The birth of twins was recorded near Gemini.<br><br>An error had been made by the original artists, so that the painted zodiac was reversed from the way it would appear in the night sky. Instead of correcting it, though, my father was diligently reinforcing the error. That night, he was working on a small square of space, gilding stars. He had already painted over the tiny yellow dots with adhesive. He covered these with a piece of gold leaf, light as breath. Then he turned to me. “Diana,” he said, holding out his hand, and I climbed up in front of him, caged by the safety of his body. He handed me a brush to sweep over the foil, fixing it in place. He showed me how to gently rub at it with my thumb, so that the galaxy he’d created was all that remained.<br><br>When all the work was finished, the conservators kept a small dark spot in the northwest corner of Grand Central Terminal, where the pale blue ceiling meets the marble wall. This nine-by-five-inch section was left that way intentionally. My father told me that conservators do that, in case historians need to study the original composition. The only way you can tell how far you’ve come is to know where you started.<br><br>Every time I’m in Grand Central Terminal, I think about my father. Of how we left that night, hand in hand, our palms glittering like we had stolen the stars.<br><br>It is Friday the thirteenth, so I should know better. Getting from Sotheby’s, on the Upper East Side, to the Ansonia, on the Upper West Side, means taking the Q train to Times Square and then the 1 uptown, so I have to travel in the wrong direction before I start going in the right one.<br><br>I hate going backward.<br><br>Normally I would walk across Central Park, but I am wearing a new pair of shoes that are rubbing a blister on my heel, shoes I never would have worn if I’d known that I was going to be summoned by Kitomi Ito. So instead, I find myself on public transit. But something’s off, and it takes me a moment to figure out what.<br><br>It’s quiet. Usually, I have to fight my way through tourists who are listening to someone singing for coins, or a violin quartet. Today, though, the atrium is empty.<br><br>Last night Broadway theaters had shut down performances for a month, after an usher tested positive for Covid, out of an abundance of caution. That’s what Finn said, anyway—New York–Presbyterian, where he is a resident, has not seen the influx of coronavirus cases that are appearing in Washington State and Italy and France. There were only nineteen cases in the city, Finn told me last night as we watched the news, when I wondered out loud if we should start panicking yet. “Wash your hands and don’t touch your face,” he told me. “It’s going to be fine.”<br><br>The uptown subway is nearly empty, too. I get off at Seventy-second and emerge aboveground, blinking like a mole, walking at a brisk New Yorker clip. The Ansonia, in all its glory, rises up like an angry djinn, defiantly jutting its Beaux Arts chin at the sky. For a moment, I just stand on the sidewalk, looking up at its mansard roof and its lazy sprawl from Seventy-third to Seventy-fourth Street. There’s a North Face and an American Apparel at ground level, but it wasn’t always this bougie. Kitomi told me that when she and Sam Pride moved in in the seventies, the building was overrun with psychics and mediums, and housed a swingers’ club with an orgy room and an open bar and buffet. Sam and I, she said, would stop in at least once a week.<br><br>I was not alive when Sam’s band, the Nightjars, was formed by Sam and his co-songwriter, William Punt, with two school chums from Slough, England. Nor was I when their first album spent thirty weeks on the Billboard charts, or when their little British quartet went on The Ed Sullivan Show and ignited a stampede of screaming American girls. Not when Sam married Kitomi Ito ten years later or when the band broke up, months after their final album was released featuring cover art of Kitomi and Sam naked, mirroring the figures in a painting that hung behind their bed. And I wasn’t alive when Sam was murdered three years later, on the steps of this very building, stabbed in the throat by a mentally ill man who recognized him from that iconic album cover.<br><br>But like everyone else on the planet, I know the whole story.<br><br>The doorman at the Ansonia smiles politely at me; the concierge looks up as I approach. “I’m here to see Kitomi Ito,” I say coolly, pushing my license across the desk to her.<br><br>“She’s expecting you,” the concierge answers. “Floor—”<br><br>“Eighteen. I know.”<br><br>Lots of celebrities have lived at the Ansonia—from Babe Ruth to Theodore Dreiser to Toscanini to Natalie Portman—but arguably, Kitomi and Sam Pride are the most famous. If my husband had been murdered on the front steps of my apartment building, I might not have stayed for another thirty years, but that’s just me. And anyway, Kitomi is finally moving now, which is why the world’s most infamous rock widow has my number in her cellphone.<br><br>What is my life, I think, as I lean against the back wall of the elevator.<br><br>When I was young, and people asked what I wanted to do when I grew up, I had a whole plan. I wanted to be securely on a path to my career, to get married by thirty, to finish having kids by thirty-five. I wanted to speak fluent French and have traveled cross-country on Route 66. My father had laughed at my checklist. You, he told me, are definitely your mother’s daughter.<br><br>I did not take that as a compliment.<br><br>Also, for the record, I’m perfectly on track. I am an associate specialist at Sotheby’s—Sotheby’s!—and Eva, my boss, has hinted in all ways possible that after the auction of Kitomi’s painting I will likely be promoted. I am not engaged, but when I ran out of clean socks last weekend and went to scrounge for a pair of Finn’s, I found a ring hidden in the back of his underwear drawer. We leave tomorrow on vacation and Finn’s going to pop the question there. I’m so sure of it that I got a manicure today instead of eating lunch.<br><br>And I’m twenty-nine.<br><br>The door to the elevator opens directly into Kitomi’s foyer, all black and white marble squares like a giant chessboard. She comes into the entryway, dressed in jeans and combat boots and a pink silk bathrobe, with a thatch of white hair and the purple heart-shaped spectacles for which she is known. She has always reminded me of a wren, light and hollow-boned. I think of how Kitomi’s black hair went white overnight with grief after Sam was murdered. I think of the photographs of her on the sidewalk, gasping for air.<br><br>“Diana!” she says, as if we are old friends.<br><br>There is a brief awkwardness as I instinctively put my hand out to take hers and then remember that is not a thing we are doing anymore and instead just give a weird little wave. “Hi, Kitomi,” I say.<br><br>“I’m so glad you could come today.”<br><br>“It’s not a problem. There are a lot of sellers who want to make sure the paperwork is handed over personally.”<br><br>Over her shoulder, at the end of a long hallway, I can see it—the Toulouse-Lautrec painting that is the entire reason I know Kitomi Ito. She sees my eyes dart toward it and her mouth tugs into a smile.<br><br>“I can’t help it,” I say. “I never get tired of seeing it.”<br><br>A strange flicker crosses Kitomi’s face. “Then let’s get you a better view,” she replies, and she leads me deeper into her home.</span>  </div>    </div> <div class=\"a-row\"> <a data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-extend-header\" data-a-expander-toggle=\'{\"allowLinkDefault\":true, \"expand_prompt\":\"Read more\", \"collapse_prompt\":\"Read less\"}\'><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a> </div> </div>    </div>                                 </div>',	14.95,	28.99,	0,	'Ballantine Books (November 30, 2021)',	'English',	'336 pages',	'1.25 pounds',	'6.42 x 1.1 x 9.54 inches',	'd2b1ab127567de067be966fc035d076704ac91de.jpg',	1,	50,	'1'),

All rights reserved.</span></h3>  <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-padding-small\"> <span>Ordinary<br><br>I know I’m not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary. I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don’t make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don’t get stared at wherever they go.<br><br>If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish that I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that look-away thing. Here’s what I think: the only reason I’m not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way.<br><br>But I’m kind of used to how I look by now. I know how to pretend I don’t see the faces people make. We’ve all gotten pretty good at that sort of thing: me, Mom and Dad, Via. Actually, I take that back: Via’s not so good at it. She can get really annoyed when people do something rude. Like, for instance, one time in the playground some older kids made some noises. I don’t even know what the noises were exactly because I didn’t hear them myself, but Via heard and she just started yelling at the kids. That’s the way she is. I’m not that way.<br><br>Via doesn’t see me as ordinary. She says she does, but if I were ordinary, she wouldn’t feel like she needs to protect me as much. And Mom and Dad don’t see me as ordinary, either. They see me as extraordinary. I think the only person in the world who realizes how ordinary I am is me.<br><br>My name is August, by the way. I won’t describe what I look like. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably worse.<br><br><br><br>Why I Didn’t Go to School<br><br>Next week I start fifth grade. Since I’ve never been to a real school before, I am pretty much totally and completely petrified. People think I haven’t gone to school because of the way I look, but it’s not that. It’s because of all the surgeries I’ve had. Twenty-seven since I was born. The bigger ones happened before I was even four years old, so I don’t remember those. But I’ve had two or three surgeries every year since then (some big, some small), and because I’m little for my age, and I have some other medical mysteries that doctors never really figured out, I used to get sick a lot. That’s why my parents decided it was better if I didn’t go to school. I’m much stronger now, though. The last surgery I had was eight months ago, and I probably won’t have to have any more for another couple of years.<br><br>Mom homeschools me. She used to be a children’s-book illustrator. She draws really great fairies and mermaids. Her boy stuff isn’t so hot, though. She once tried to draw me a Darth Vader, but it ended up looking like some weird mushroom-shaped robot. I haven’t seen her draw anything in a long time. I think she’s too busy taking care of me and Via.<br><br>I can’t say I always wanted to go to school because that wouldn’t be exactly true. What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could be like every other kid going to school. Have lots of friends and hang out after school and stuff like that.<br><br>I have a few really good friends now. Christopher is my best friend, followed by Zachary and Alex. We’ve known each other since we were babies. And since they’ve always known me the way I am, they’re used to me. When we were little, we used to have playdates all the time, but then Christopher moved to Bridgeport in Connecticut. That’s more than an hour away from where I live in North River Heights, which is at the top tip of Manhattan. And Zachary and Alex started going to school. It’s funny: even though Christopher’s the one who moved far away, I still see him more than I see Zachary and Alex. They have all these new friends now. If we bump into each other on the street, they’re still nice to me, though. They always say hello.<br><br>I have other friends, too, but not as good as Christopher and Zack and Alex were. For instance, Zack and Alex always invited me to their birthday parties when we were little, but Joel and Eamonn and Gabe never did. Emma invited me once, but I haven’t seen her in a long time. And, of course, I always go to Christopher’s birthday. Maybe I’m making too big a deal about birthday parties.<br><br><br><br>How I Came to Life<br><br>I like when Mom tells this story because it makes me laugh so much. It’s not funny in the way a joke is funny, but when Mom tells it, Via and I just start cracking up.<br><br>So when I was in my mom’s stomach, no one had any idea I would come out looking the way I look. Mom had had Via four years before, and that had been such a “walk in the park” (Mom’s expression) that there was no reason to run any special tests. About two months before I was born, the doctors realized there was something wrong with my face, but they didn’t think it was going to be bad. They told Mom and Dad I had a cleft palate and some other stuff going on. They called it “small anomalies.”<br><br>There were two nurses in the delivery room the night I was born. One was very nice and sweet. The other one, Mom said, did not seem at all nice or sweet. She had very big arms and (here comes the funny part), she kept farting. Like, she’d bring Mom some ice chips, and then fart. She’d check Mom’s blood pressure, and fart. Mom says it was unbelievable because the nurse never even said excuse me! Meanwhile, Mom’s regular doctor wasn’t on duty that night, so Mom got stuck with this cranky kid doctor she and Dad nicknamed Doogie after some old TV show or something (they didn’t actually call him that to his face). But Mom says that even though everyone in the room was kind of grumpy, Dad kept making her laugh all night long.<br><br>When I came out of Mom’s stomach, she said the whole room got very quiet. Mom didn’t even get a chance to look at me because the nice nurse immediately rushed me out of the room. Dad was in such a hurry to follow her that he dropped the video camera, which broke into a million pieces. And then Mom got very upset and tried to get out of bed to see where they were going, but the farting nurse put her very big arms on Mom to keep her down in the bed. They were practically fighting, because Mom was hysterical and the farting nurse was yelling at her to stay calm, and then they both started screaming for the doctor. But guess what? He had fainted! Right on the floor! So when the farting nurse saw that he had fainted, she started pushing him with her foot to get him to wake up, yelling at him the whole time: “What kind of doctor are you? What kind of doctor are you? Get up! Get up!” And then all of a sudden she let out the biggest, loudest, smelliest fart in the history of farts. Mom thinks it was actually the fart that finally woke the doctor up. Anyway, when Mom tells this story, she acts out all the parts--including the farting noises--and it is so, so, so, so funny!<br><br>Mom says the farting nurse turned out to be a very nice woman. She stayed with Mom the whole time. Didn’t leave her side even after Dad came back and the doctors told them how sick I was. Mom remembers exactly what the nurse whispered in her ear when the doctor told her I probably wouldn’t live through the night: “Everyone born of God overcometh the world.” And the next day, after I had lived through the night, it was that nurse who held Mom’s hand when they brought her to meet me for the first time.<br><br>Mom says by then they had told her all about me. She had been preparing herself for the seeing of me. But she says that when she looked down into my tiny mushed-up face for the first time, all she could see was how pretty my eyes were.<br><br>Mom is beautiful, by the way. And Dad is handsome. Via is pretty.

This also marks Thelonious Monk’s only appearance on Atlantic Records. The result is a true meeting of the minds, a beautiful union of Monk’s melodies with Blakey’s unshakable sense of swing. This 65thAnniversary deluxe edition includes an extra disc ofunreleased outtakes, celebrating the most sensational jazz collaboration of the 1950s.</span>  </p>          </div>',	'ac3359934c62b52c5761c7cb0fee6c4ceffc76a2.jpg',	1,	50,	2),

With a superb production from the talented producer Damien Rainaud, the Symphony X, Dream Theater and Queen-inspired music from the Code d\'Azur quartet is a statement, carved in stone!\"Back home\" does not only mean back home to Earth for the space-travellers in the story of the concept, but it also means back home for the band, as they have returned to their original roots: to compose and create true, progressive masterpieces, for every album they make. In space, no one hears you scream, but S.U.E. are definitely set to make themselves heard here on Earth with \"Back Home\".Having toured extensively over the last few years; from France to Denmark, from Holland to Poland and from Italy to the USA, S.U.E. has explored the boundaries of the musical life within the genre, and have now spent the last five years composing what is to be the absolute pinnacle of their career so far, namely the space-concept album \"Back Home\".</span>  </p>          </div>',	'e33016612149699b1e7a6c680fe3a5ed137d8326.jpg',	1,	50,	2),

Iconic singer Mavis Staples is an alchemist of American music, and during her 70+ year career one of her most beloved musical moments was her riveting performance in Martin Scorsese\'s film The Last Waltz, performing \"The Weight\", with The Band, a moment that forged a life-long friendship between her and Levon Helm. Staples came to Woodstock, NY to perform as part of Helm\'s renowned Midnight Ramble series, and the ensuing concert-available now for the first time on Carry Me Home-would mark a personal high watermark for both artists. Captured live in the summer of 2011, Carry Me Home showcases two of the past century\'s most iconic voices coming together in love and joy, tracing their shared roots and celebrating the enduring power of faith and music. The result is an album that\'s at once a time capsule and a memorial, a blissful homecoming and a fond farewell, a once-in-a-lifetime concert-and friendship-preserved for the ages.</span>  </p>          </div>',	'82d39db18decfec0fd17439558fb338fbe3b8274.jpg',	1,	50,	2),

It was unique among their albums in that the material was written and recorded in North America.The band recruited Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick to man the console at Sound City and Bijou Studios in Hollywood to record this final album. What emerged from these sessions was a comparatively straightforward high-energy rock album, with hook laden songs and clever choruses. Undoubtedly a musical vindication of Giant\'s decision to move further towards the \'progressive rock mainstream\', and the logical conclusion of the work begun on 1976\'s \'Interview\'. Despite having paired down earlier characteristic elements, Gentle Giant retained their quintessential brilliant musicianship moving forward into the new decade.As a bonus on this, the newly mastered reissue of \'Civilian\', and therefore it\'s first official outing on CD, a rare previously unissued track is included. \'Heroes No More\' was recorded during the \'Civilian\' sessions but failed to appear only because of the need to keep running times down on the old vinyl format. Remastered it is a fantastic addition to the album.\'Civilian\' was the last in a line of strikingly original albums, each with it\'s own character, but each recorded with the same care and attention to detail. Gentle Giant were a unique proposition, five talented musicians with the ability to blend widely differing musical traditions into a coherent whole.Decades after the initial release of \"Civilian\' fans of the band old and new have come to realize what an incredibly strong and superbly written and produced album Civilian really was.

On election day 2020, when I saw that there was a good chance the state of Georgia might go blue, I came up with an idea: to record an album of Georgia- related songs as a thank you to the state and donate the money to a Georgia based non-profit organization. I will admit my motivations were a bit selfish. For years, I’ve been looking for an excuse to record these songs with my band and some friends. The songs on this album are some of my favorite Georgia-related songs, but the tracklist is not meant to be comprehensive. I would love to cover Outkast and 2 Chainz, but I don’t think the finished product would be very good. We’re a rock band, so we covered rock songs. We have roots in blues and R&amp;B, so we enlisted some brilliant artists to help us pull off songs by Precious Bryant, James Brown, and Gladys Knight. My favorite part of the Georgia Blue recording process was having the opportunity to work with these very special artists, and I thank them: Amanda Shires, Brittney Spencer, Adia Victoria, Brandi Carlile, Julien Baker, Bèla Fleck, Chris Thile, Steve Gorman, Peter Levin, and John Paul White.

(John 3:16) As the central theme of the Gospel message, this scripture is probably the best known passage. And this message is one that The Perrys share through every album and every concert. The title cut from the album, \"John 3:16 Is Calling Out To You,\" has already released digitally and to radio and it is gaining traction. Putting this scripture into song feels familiar and comforting - something The Perrys also long for these days. With numerous changes over the last few years, they are blessed to be able to look back and find consistency. Wayne Haun has been a long-time friend and producer for Libbi Perry Stuffle and The Perrys. He helps them find just the right songs and then pushes each member to give their best in the studio. He knows their sound. His care and expertise is evident throughout the entire album John 3:16. The Perrys have also been fortunate to record many songs by the famed songstress Kyla Rowland. When Kyla passed away just a few weeks ago, it brought comfort to The Perrys that they had already received a song from their beautiful friend for this upcoming recording. It may well be the final new recording of a Kyla Rowland song. Also providing consistency for The Perrys is this recording of songs with themes of victory, encouragement, salvation, and redemption.</span>  </p>          </div>',	'3c87f86f4d2f8f797cb00b37c08f38be0ca48271.jpg',	1,	50,	2),

Although only 3 tracks, each song showcases a depth and diversity that is uncommon in modern metal. Heart-wrenching ballads are blended perfectly with technical shredding &amp; crushing breakdowns, effortlessly showcasing the band\'s talent as genuine songwriters. Despite the hard-fought success, Malevolence remains an autonomous crew. Operating from their Sheffield-based HQ, a previously derelict warehouse the band transformed themselves, Malevolence handles as much of their in-house operations as they possibly can. Including the formation and operation of Malevolence\'s own label, MLVLTD Music. It was through this label that the band self-released \'The Other Side\' and although it was a first for the band, the release was a resounding success - racking up close to half a million streams on Spotify and Apple Music in it\'s first few weeks of release.Malevolence fans will know that their records come few and far between. Emerging onto the scene in 2013 with their debut album Reign of Suffering, which is currently climbing above 2.15 million streams on Spotify. Released as teenagers, the level of song crafting skill stands the test of time and remains a defining moment in the band\'s career. The next four years had Malevolence grinding their way through the European continent, gaining recognition as one of the hottest prospects in this new wave of international heavy metal. 2017\'s Self Supremacy saw the Sheffield quintet selling out club shows all over Europe, the USA, and even south-east Asia/Japan. This in turn has earned them a cult-like following of die-hard fans, who wear the Malevolence logo on their clothing like a medal of honour.Now waiting with a brand-new album and plans to tour amongst some of the biggest names in heavy music, Malevolence are poised to become the next legacy name in all of heavy music.</span>  </p>          </div>',	'05ed0a580f20a36c09b2722e50919ea248c96aa0.jpg',	1,	50,	2),

Lai, Vietnam. The unimaginable brutality of the event impacted all those who witnessed it firsthand, including helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson, who, against orders, intervened to save Vietnamese lives. Thompson\'s story is the basis of the opera M? Lai, composed by Jonathan Berger (music) and Harriet Scott Chessman (libretto) for Kronos Quartet, Vietnamese multi-instrumentalist Vânnh Vanessa Võ, and vocalist Rinde Eckert. This definitive recording of M? Lai captures the visceral, phantasmal depictions of Thompson\'s grief, horror, and guilt as he is haunted by persistent memories of that cataclysmic day, half a world and nearly four decades away. Tense and unforgiving, M? Lai is \"a gripping affair, beginning to end\" (New York Times). Presented here alongside recollections by Vietnamese survivor Tr?n Van Ð?c, it is a memorial to all the M? Lai villagers killed on that grim day.</span>  </p>          </div>',	'1f0c211294a43e08b01f854386567d8cf0bb6101.jpg',	1,	50,	2),

The characters and settings may have changed, but the startling narrative has not. In late 2001, Conor Oberst, Denver Dalley, Landon Hedges, Ian McElroy, and Matt Baum spent a week at Presto! Recording Studio in Lincoln, NE recording a punk album. That debut album, released in the post-9/11 fog of early 2002, screamed out observational commentary on urban development, the sacrifice of human value for the dollar bill, and the new American Dream in a way that felt distinctly out of sync with the hyper-patriotic atmosphere of peak G.W. Bush-era America. The band toured, got a bit of attention, and then went their separate ways for a long spell. In the ensuing years, Read Music/Speak Spanish gained cult status and became one of the most beloved and meaningful documents of the era, capturing the alienation that those who had seen through the fog of war for $$$$ experienced at the time. 20 years on, those feelings are just as, if not more, relevant than they were in that moment. America has mutated into a new frightening version of itself, in many ways unimaginable two decades ago. Yet, the fear and disgust voiced on Read Music/Speak Spanish now sound more prophetic than paranoid, making the album\'s message as necessary as ever. 1.

Thirteen wicked hot songs of love, loss, lust, life-from the Farfisa-fueled, warped psycho-punk rave-up of \"Junk Man,\" to the intimate lover\'s plea of \"My Hit Parade,\" to the outer-space, end-of-days country funk of \"Worm Town,\" Spencer Gets It Lit delivers all of the friction, excitement, and post-modern depravity one could ever ask for!

But in 2022, the Grammy-nominated blues masters latest album, Straight From The Heart, finds him drawn by the siren call of his hometown and musical ground zero, Baton Rouge. Neal both led and produced a crack team of local musicians at his own Brookstown Recording Studios. All the tributaries of the blues converge here, flowing into one rich tradition. Lining up in the studio alongside his Baton Rouge compadrés, the respect that Neal commands on the scene also drew some special guests, including hot-tip blues sensation Christone Kingfish Ingram, pop royalty Tito Jackson, and two songs with Rockin Dopsie Junior &amp; The Zydeco Twisters.

A potpourri of fresh covers from the American Songbook, sprinkled with new, original compositions, embellished by thoughtful arrangements, played by some of the finest musicians, Truly was recorded, mixed and mastered to perfection. Joe Cali, executive producer, assembled a Grammy award winning crew for Truly. Lori \'s voice is in shockingly fine form, but wait until you hear Matt Rollings on piano &amp; Hammond B-3 organ and the amazing Lyle Workman on guitar. The album was co-produced by Lori Lieberman and Matt Rollings.  Recorded &amp; mixed by Bob Clearmountain and mastered by Darcy Proper.  This is Lori\'s finest sounding album. Eight songs are covers which Lori listened to with her father, while driving in Switzerland as a child, bopping to an eight track car stereo. Two originals were co-written forty years ago with Joe Harnell and never previously recorded. While there is one fresh composition, the title track \"Truly\" and a wonderful re-imagining of Lori\'s classic - \"Killing Me Softly\".  Matt Rollings gorgeous jazz improvisation on piano opens the song,  later the song is fleshed out by David Pitch (bass), Victor Indrizzo (drums) &amp; Lyle Workman (guitar). In contrast, the original version, recorded when Lori was 19, sounds truly dated. Lori\'s new version, here on Truly, is the most heartfelt and brought the experienced Bob Clearmountain to tears. Lori\'s \"Moonlight In Vermont\" sounds remarkably fresh and current. The song opens with Matt Rollings piano which provides a wonderful counterpoint to her singing. When the rhythm section and Lyle Workman on guitar join in, the party starts to swing. Lyle Workman\'s  twenty second guitar sorbet  is clean &amp; refreshing, every note tugs at your heart. We are talking goosebumps territory here.  Lori continues singing with the band in full swing - it\'s glorious. Her singing displays maturity &amp; delivers wonderful shades of emotion &amp; passion. This is a top shelf project and it sounds it.</span>  </p>          </div>',	'6898ce259f5e61714fe2b3c00979d492b3ebf76d.jpg',	1,	50,	2),

She had called the band\'s third full-length, Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder To The Sky, an image that\'s partly inspired by a collage by the surrealist artist Eileen Agar, and evokes the ducks and dives, slippery slopes and existential angst of life. But Dana was also drawn to the story of Jacob\'s Ladder from the Old Testament which, \"symbolises the ups and downs of human life, of virtue and sin,\" she explains. This idea that no one emotional state is binary came like a lightning bolt. \"Within this album the feelings of joy, fear and endlessness coexist together,\" says Dana. That mix of emotions has defined Porridge Radio\'s past two years to say the least. It\'s a strange sensation, becoming a breakthrough band who are breathlessly championed by every major music site, without being able to experience any of it in the real world. When they released their 2020 album Every Bad, they were about to fly to South By Southwest, support Car Seat Headrest across the States, and then tear up the festival circuit back home. But it was all cancelled due to the pandemic. In spite of that, they\'ve managed to become one of the UK\'s most thrilling acts, from DIY darlings to a Mercury-nominated tour de force in the space of less than a year. Perhaps that\'s because their barbed wit, lacerating intensity and potent blend of art-rock, indie-pop and post-punk sounds like little else around. For Dana and drummer Sam Yardley, keyboardist Georgie Stott and bassist Maddie Ryall - who met in Brighton and formed a band in 2014 - global recognition had been a long time coming, after years of booking their own tours and self-releasing their music. But in some ways, Dana welcomed the pause. She had been struggling to reconcile the lo-fi Dana of the Brighton scene with Bona Fide Indie Star Dana, hurtling into a new league - not only a musician but an artist in every sense, who has painted all three of Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder To The Sky\'s expressive covers. Suddenly, there were magazine covers instead of fanzines. Then lockdown landed. \"It\'s actually terrifying to be seen,\" she says. \"I was having panic attacks all the time, because I was aware of being perceived in a new way.\" Margolin was quickly becoming regarded as one of the most magnetic band leaders around with an ability to \"devastate you with an emotional hurricane, then blindside you with a moment of bittersweet humour\" (NME). But if Every Bad established Dana\'s bravery in laying herself bare, her band\'s third record takes that to anthemic new heights. Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder To The Sky is the sound of someone in their late twenties thrashing out how they feel during these confusing, frustrating, stop-start years, facing down the disappointment of love, and life, and figuring out how to exist in the world, without claiming any answers. Dana\'s songwriting and delivery is more confident, with the emotional incisiveness of artists like Mitski, Sharon Van Etten and Big Thief. While there are moments of guttural release, she also finds soft power on songs like the piano-led \'Flowers\' and the closing title track, where she sings over an acoustic guitar. \"I used to think I had to be loud to be heard,\" she admits, \"but now I\'m definitely less afraid of being gentle.\" Thematically, Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder To The Sky is as unwavering as ever. Existential dread, death, health anxiety, loneliness and the comfort of connection are wrangled with. Dana\'s streams of consciousness turn the mirror, often unflatteringly, on her weaknesses and she attempts to take ownership of her \"bad habits\". \"I\'m embarrassed by how vicious I can be sometimes,\" she admits. The songs have a physicality about them, a fleshy rawness, but they\'re also open to risk, dealing with the powerful catharsis that occurs when you allow the full intensity of an experience to take hold - perhaps something that we instinctively resist. \"Most people are terrified about confronting emotion,\" says Dana, \"or of reckoning with yourself. But writing has always been a place where I can lean into that.\" It\'s what\'s always set them apart from their peers in UK guitar music and on WSDBLTTS they sound more in line at times with the American emo greats. \"We\'re making music in a scene that is very emotionally repressed,\" she continues, \"sometimes if I listen to nu-metal or emo lyrics, I find that we seem to fit in better emotionally in that world. They\'re as cringe as me. \' The band\'s first new single, \'Back To The Radio\', sets out their stall, a lurching call to arms that contrasts Dana\'s lyrics of panic and closing herself off - \"lock all the windows and march up the stairs\" - with a rousing end-of-night chorus made for clutching your friends closely. The band\'s sound, co-produced by Tom Carmichael, Dana and drummer Sam Yardley, has also stepped up: it\'s panoramic and sparkling, elevated by ambitious instrumentals. \"I kept saying that I wanted everything to be \'stadium epic\', - like Coldplay,\" says Dana, with a knowing smile. If that sounds like a jarring proclamation then a glance over the list of references whose names came up during the creative process - first at PRAH Studios in Margate and then at Eastbourne\'s Echo Zoo - reveals influences as varied as Bruce Springsteen, Beach House, Carly Rae Jepsen and Brighton alt-poppers The Go! Team. WDBLTTS never sounds studied - the band has distilled their myriad influences into a sound that\'s unequivocally Porridgey - although some songs have clearer outlines. They describe \'Jealousy\' as Deftones meets Portishead, with it\'s trip-hop crunch, ghostly piano and careening wall of static. The album\'s climactic single \'The Rip\', possibly their most ambitious song yet, with it\'s gloriously widescreen distortion that does exactly as the title suggests, is their attempt to do a Charli XCX-sized pop take on alt-rock. These were opportunities for Dana to test her limits as a musician. \"My guitar playing got stronger, I was writing parts I didn\'t know how to play and then having to learn them,\" she says. \"I tried to push myself out of my comfort zone all the time. If you listen to our debut album [2015\'s Rice, Pasta and Other Fillers], the songs are good but there\'s a recklessness to them because I was so keen to finish them quickly and move on to the next. This time I was trying to exercise patience.\" WDBLTTS also explores something that Porridge Radio are perhaps less known for: playfulness. They created a junk-shop drumkit out of \"metal ashtray buckets from the car yard outside the studio\", which you can hear on \'I Hope She\'s OK 2\' and \'Trying\'. The playful wibble of the synthesiser punctuates songs with jangle-pop - and that playfulness extends to their visuals, too, like the pastel papier-mâché world, created by Dana\'s sister Ella, of the \'Back To The Radio\' video. \"I think the album needed to have that balance,\" Dana explains, adding that it reflects how she moves through the world: \"If I\'m broken down on the floor crying, of course I need compassion, but I also need people to laugh at me and with me, I need to be reminded how absurd everything is.\" Balance: that\'s the word that Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder To The Sky seems to be eternally striving for - joy, fear and endlessness in harmony. But there\'s also self-acceptance. Dana is more aware of how she\'s creating a persona as her star continues to rise, and how she\'s singing personal songs that now belong to other people. She\'s had people tell her that her Every Bad got them through their cancer diagnosis, their break-up, their isolated lockdown. But now she feels it gives her purpose. \"It makes me think, \'Okay, there\'s some use in this self indulgent thing I\'m doing\',\" she says. \"I wrote these songs for myself but I think everyone wants to feel like what they\'re doing is useful</span>  </p>          </div',	'd9c6d4f243bdf59cf30fd36a8db91c776b0f7b6e.jpg',	1,	50,	2),
